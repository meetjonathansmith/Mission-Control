### 3. BRIAR COCHRAN (@briarcochran)
**Followers:** 23K  
**Bio:** "I help people better understand content and positioning"  
**Positioning:** Content strategist focused on positioning + format innovation

**Content Philosophy (from Substack research):**

**Core Principles:**
1. **Format Over Everything (2026)** - Unique visual presentation beats polished execution
2. **Counter-Positioning Power** - Define what you're AGAINST, not just what you're FOR
3. **Stage-Based Strategy:**
   - Stage 1: Master talking head basics
   - Stage 2: Copy proven formats
   - Stage 3: Innovate unique formats
4. **The Accordion Method** - Start 1x/day until consistent 1-2K views, then scale volume
5. **High-Quality Followers > Volume** - 2K true fans > 20K disengaged followers

**50+ Content Principles:**
- Format diversification (2-3 core formats to protect against algorithm changes)
- Personal brand must keep creator at center (face/presence required)
- Fixed variables for data analysis (map topic/funnel stage/format)
- Seven-day content cycles (predictable rhythm reduces decision fatigue)
- Topic-Format-Illustration-Hook hierarchy for analyzing outliers
- Specificity creates connection (specific beats broad)
- Visual association & vibes (props/backgrounds create subconscious associations)
- Contrast drives attention (poor vs rich, $1 vs $1000)
- Hook-delivery separation (first 3-5 seconds separate from main content)
- Native hooks over direct promotion

**Format Innovation Tactics:**
- Whiteboard/visual teaching (4-6 weeks left before saturation as of Jan 2026)
- Presentation/slideshow style (Gamma AI workflow: 10-15 min from idea to video)
- Over-the-shoulder process (Meta glasses filming workflow)
- Clone/dialogue videos (freeze frame non-speaker, 40 feather setting on mask)
- Timer bars for process videos (creates retention pressure)

**Growth Milestones:**
- **0-10K:** Post 5-7x/week, master 1-2 formats, build skill
- **10K-50K:** Test format variations, 3-5x/week, refine positioning
- **50K-100K:** Strategic posting 3-4x/week, team building begins
- **100K+:** Content serves business, not proving yourself

## UNIVERSAL VIRAL PATTERNS (CROSS-ACCOUNT SYNTHESIS)

### Hook Structure Anatomy (First 3-5 Seconds)

**Proven Hook Templates:**
1. **Proof Hook:** "$X results in Y time..." (Meagan Hall style)
2. **Contrarian Hook:** "Most [people] don't know..." (Briar Cochran style)
3. **Story Hook:** "When I was [situation]..." (Jade Sprake style)
4. **Question Hook:** "How much do you pay for..." (Caleb Ralston style)
5. **Update Hook:** "This new [change] will..." (Sam Gaudet style)
6. **Behind-the-Scenes Hook:** "Here's what actually happened..." (All accounts)

**Hook Performance Factors:**
- First 5-7 words determine scroll-stop rate
- Specificity > Generic ("$2.78M" vs "a lot of money")
- Numbers + timeframes create credibility
- Personal story > abstract advice
- Native curiosity > direct promotion

---

### Emotional Progression Patterns

**Classic 3-Act Structure (30-60 second Reels):**

**Act 1: Hook + Problem (0-5 seconds)**
- Stop scroll with hook
- Establish relatable pain point
- Create curiosity gap

**Act 2: Education + Value (5-45 seconds)**
- Deliver on promise
- Teach framework/system
- Build trust through expertise
- Visual variety (text overlays, B-roll, whiteboard)

**Act 3: CTA + Engagement (45-60 seconds)**
- Clear call to action (DM keyword, comment, save, share)
- Future promise ("Follow for more...")
- Engagement trigger ("Comment X if you want Y...")

**Emotional Journey:**
1. **Curiosity** (hook) → 2. **Recognition** (I have this problem) → 3. **Hope** (there's a solution) → 4. **Trust** (this person can help) → 5. **Action** (I'll engage/follow/buy)

---

### CTA Strategy Breakdown

**High-Converting CTAs (by goal):**

**For Lead Generation:**
- "Comment [KEYWORD]" (automate with ManyChat)

**For Engagement:**
- "Share this with someone who needs to hear it"

**CTA Placement:**
- Primary CTA: Last 5 seconds of video + caption
- Secondary CTA: Pinned comment
- Tertiary CTA: Bio link
- Never ask for multiple actions (one clear CTA per post)

---

### Format Innovation (2026 Trends)

**Current High-Performers:**
1. **Whiteboard/Visual Teaching** (4-6 weeks left before saturation)
   - Draw/write while explaining
   - Arrows, circles, keywords
   - Focus attention, not showcase art skill

2. **Presentation/Slideshow** (2-3 months of peak performance)
   - Gamma AI workflow
   - Voice note → ChatGPT outline → Gamma slides
   - 10-15 min from idea to finished video

3. **Over-the-Shoulder Process**
   - Film actual workflow (Meta glasses ideal)
   - Voyeuristic + educational
   - Shows system in action

4. **Clone/Dialogue Videos**
   - Split-screen conversations with self
   - Freeze non-speaking person
   - 40 feather setting on mask
   - Different perspectives/objections

5. **Talking Head + Strong Text Overlay**
   - Baseline format (always works)
   - Progressive text reveals
   - 7-8/10 communication skill required
   - Clear framing + good lighting

**Format Lifecycle:**
- Every format has 6-12 month peak
- Diversify to 2-3 core formats

- Test new formats while maintaining core

---

**Trust Builders:**
1. **Visible Imperfection**
   - Not overly polished editing
   - Real locations (not studio sets)
   - Authentic emotion/energy
   - Mistakes left in occasionally

   - Screenshots of results
   - Specific numbers (not "a lot")

   - "I used to struggle with..."
   - Admitting current challenges
   - Humanizing the journey

4. **Consistency**
   - Regular posting schedule
   - Recognizable format/style
   - Predictable value delivery
   - Long-term presence (not fly-by-night)

5. **No-Hype Language**

   - Honest about effort required
   - Clear about who it's NOT for

**Inauthenticity Red Flags to Avoid:**

- Overpromising results
- Stock footage pretending to be personal

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC TACTICS

### Instagram Reels Optimization

**Algorithm Priorities (2026):**
1. Hook rate (% who watch past 3 seconds)
2. Retention (average % watched)
3. Replays (viewer watches 2+ times)
4. Saves (strongest signal of value)
5. Shares (especially DM shares)
6. Comments (quality > quantity)

**Technical Specs:**
- 9:16 vertical format
- 30-60 seconds ideal (90 max before reach drops)
- 1080x1920 resolution minimum
- Upload directly (not cross-post from TikTok)
- Trending audio helps discovery (but not required)
- Text overlays on-screen (most watch without sound)

**Posting Strategy:**
- 3-5x/week minimum for growth
- Consistency > frequency
- Best times: 6-9am, 12-2pm, 7-10pm ET
- Avoid late night posts (poor initial performance)

**Caption Strategy:**
- Front-load value (first 125 chars shown without "See more")
- 3-4 relevant hashtags (not 30)
- CTA at end
- Line breaks for readability
- @ mentions at end (not beginning)

---

### TikTok Optimization

**Key Differences from Instagram:**
- Volume rewarded (can post 15x/day if sustainable)
- FYP algorithm more aggressive (easier to go viral from zero)
- Younger demographic (Gen Z vs Millennial)
- Trend-driven (audio/format trends matter more)

**Strategy:**
- Higher posting frequency (7-14x/week)
- Faster pacing (hook in 1 second, not 3)
- On-screen text essential
- Comments/stitches/duets drive reach
- Series content performs well ("Part 1 of...")

---

### LinkedIn (B2B plays)

**Different Rules:**
- **NO** hashtags (LinkedIn deprioritizes them)
- Long-form text posts perform well
- Professional tone, but personality matters
- Commenting > posting for growth
- Thought leadership > entertainment

**Best for:**
- B2B consulting positioning
- Speaking opportunities
- Corporate partnerships
- Professional credibility

---

## MONETIZATION MODELS (What Works 2026)

### Model 1: Education/Courses (Meagan Hall approach)
- Digital products ($50-500)
- High volume required
- Low-touch delivery
- Scalable once created
- Requires large audience (50K+)

**Revenue Formula:** Price x Daily Sales x 30 days  
Example: $250 product x 10 sales/day = $75K/month

### Model 2: Consulting/Coaching (Jade Sprake/Briar Cochran approach)
- High-ticket 1-on-1 ($2-5K/month per client)
- Low volume required (5-10 clients)
- High-touch delivery
- Not scalable (time-for-money)
- Works with smaller audience (10K+)

**Revenue Formula:** Price x Client Count  
Example: $3K/month x 10 clients = $30K/month

### Model 3: Group Programs (Hybrid)
- Medium-ticket ($1-2K/month)
- Medium volume (20-50 participants)
- Medium-touch delivery
- Somewhat scalable
- Requires moderate audience (20K+)

**Revenue Formula:** Price x Participant Count  
Example: $1K/month x 30 participants = $30K/month

### Model 4: B2B Retainers (Caleb Ralston/Sam Gaudet approach)
- High-ticket ($5-10K/month per company)
- Very low volume (3-8 companies)
- Custom delivery
- Limited scalability
- Requires strong credibility

**Revenue Formula:** Monthly Retainer x Company Count  
Example: $7K/month x 5 companies = $35K/month

### Model 5: Speaking + Licensing (Authority play)
- Premium rates ($10-25K per engagement)
- Occasional income
- Requires 100K+ following + proven results
- 3-5 year build minimum

**Smart Money Stack:**
Combine multiple models for diversified income:
- 3-5 consulting clients ($15K/month)
- 1 digital product ($10K/month passive)
- 2-3 B2B retainers ($15K/month)
- Occasional speaking ($5K/month averaged)
**Total: $45K/month from multiple streams**
