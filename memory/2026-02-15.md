## QUILL CONTENT SYSTEM REPLACEMENT (8:11 PM EST)

**Event:** Jonathan replaced entire Quill content operating system

**Reason:** "Quill's content calendar has missed twice"

**Old System DELETED:**
- 6-pillar structure (Faith in Fight 25%, Agent Freedom 25%, Documenting 20%, Starting Over 10%, Leading Men 10%, Contrarian 10%)
- Weekly rhythm (Mon Faith, Tue Doc, Wed AF, Thu Doc/AF, Fri Faith, Sat Rotating)
- War language allowed
- Vague options allowed

**New System V2 IMPLEMENTED:**

### 4 Content Pillars
1. Life In Christ (God's goodness, peace, joy, guidance)
2. Documenting The Climb (real-time building)
3. Agent Freedom (ownership, equity, passive income for agents)
4. Leadership & Life (starting over in 40s, leading men, family, character)

### Weekly Structure (Non-Negotiable)
- Monday: Life In Christ
- Tuesday: Documenting The Climb
- Wednesday: Agent Freedom
- Thursday: Tactical Game Plan
- Friday: Leadership & Life
- Saturday: Contrarian Take or Agent Freedom

### Required Strategic Layers (Every Week)
- One recurring series for agents (e.g., "Agent Freedom File #1, #2...")
- One proof/receipts post (deal breakdown, before/after, testimonial)
- One clear offer/invitation post (DM keyword, comment action)
- One belief-shifting post (challenge limiting beliefs)

### Tone (Non-Negotiable)
- **NO WAR OR BATTLE LANGUAGE** (no fight, grind, hustle, war, attack)
- Christ life is good, God is kind, calm/confident/grounded
- Document don't lecture
- Specific not generic
- Show humanity + growth, not just highlights

### Output Format
Exact structure required:
- Day, Pillar, Series, Format, Title
- Hook option 1, Hook option 2
- Talking points (3-4 bullets)
- CTA (clear call to action)

**Jonathan's directive:** "Follow it exactly. No improvising. No war language. No vague options. Every week must include the required strategic layers. Every day must follow the exact output format. This is non-negotiable."

**Files Updated:**
- Created: `memory/quill-content-directive-v2.md` (6KB, permanent reference)
- Updated: `MEMORY.md` (replaced Agent Freedom section with Quill V2 system)
- Old system completely deleted from memory

**Status:** ACTIVE — All future content must follow V2 directive
