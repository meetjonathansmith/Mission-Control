## Session Context
Pre-compaction memory flush. Capturing afternoon/evening progress after 11:47 AM flush.

## Smith Letter Research - COMPLETED

**Delivered**: 12:00-12:10 PM  
**Status**: Research complete, copied to Desktop for easy access  
**Location**: `memory/smith-letter-research-feb17.md` + `/Users/alfred/Desktop/smith-letter-research-feb17.md`

**Format confirmed with Jonathan**: 6 stories (3 "What's Moving the Market" + 3 "What's Worth Watching"), each with headline, 4-6 sentence description with data, "Why it matters:" operator analysis (2-3 sentences), source URL

**3 Major Shifts Researched**:
1. Trump Executive Order Targets Wall Street in Housing Market
2. Mortgage Affordability Hits Four-Year High
3. Housing for the 21st Century Act Passes House 390-9

**3 Emerging Trends Researched**:
1. Foreclosure Activity Rises for 11th Straight Month
2. Insurance Costs Reshape Homebuyer Decisions

## Cost Optimization - APPROVED

**API Spend Current**: $151.01/$300 monthly limit (50% through month, $266/month pace)

**Brains & Muscles Model - APPROVED WITH MODIFICATION**:
- BRAIN (Claude Sonnet 4.5): Strategic, underwriting, financial planning, complex problems, content strategy, **CODE GENERATION**
- MUSCLE 1 (Claude Haiku): Daily briefings, content drafts, data extraction, routine updates
- MUSCLE 2 (GPT-4o-mini): Web research, data analysis - **NOT code generation**
- MUSCLE 3 (Brave Search API): All web searches ($5/month flat)

**Jonathan's Directive**: "Broken code costs more than tokens" - Code generation MUST stay on BRAIN

**Target**: $105/month (61% reduction from $266/month pace)

**Additional Optimizations**:
- Cron jobs: Mon-Fri only (skip weekends) - saves 15-20%
- Context discipline: Load only what's needed per task - saves 10-15%
- Thinking mode: Off - saves 5-10%

**Files Created**:
- `memory/model-routing-rules.md` (3.9KB) - Full implementation plan
- OpenAI API key saved to `memory/credentials/openai.env`

---

## Cron Jobs Updated

**Changes Made**:
1. Daily briefings: Mon-Fri only (was 7 days/week)
2. Daily KPI Sheet Update: DISABLED (using 8:45 AM standup instead)
3. Weekend coverage: Friday Board Meeting + Sunday Week Ahead provide context

**Rationale**: Weekend = family time, reduce API burn, batch coverage via Board + Week Ahead

---

## YouTube Strategy - NEW DIRECTIVE

**Delivered**: 12:46 PM  
**Platform Decision**: YouTube = PRIMARY MINISTRY PLATFORM

**Content Angle**: Building in public (show what I'm doing, not "you should do this")

**Unique Edge**: Pastoral-level Bible knowledge + Real business results ($80M closed, 17 rentals, DTA model) - nobody else has both

**Instagram/Reels = Secondary**: Short clips from YouTube + daily DTA content

**4 Creators to Study**:
1. Kyle Mechlinski - @KyleMechlinski
2. Goshen Official - @Goshen.Official
3. Myron Golden - @MyronGolden
4. Rabbi Daniel Lapin - @rabbidaniellapin

**Quill Research Deliverable**: Format analysis, topic overlaps, first 10 video concepts (building in public, not lecturing)

---

## Priority Queue Established

**Confirmed Order** (12:47 PM):
1. LinkedIn posts 1-3 (reverse prompt: "Quill, what would hit hardest?")
2. YouTube Episode 1 outline ("I Built an AI Council" → #youtube-planning)
3. Mission Control navigation rebuild (watching video tonight, building while Jonathan sleeps)
4. Approvals Queue build (Quill stages content, Jonathan batch reviews)
5. YouTube channel analysis (study 4 creators, propose 10 concepts)

**Rule**: No jumping ahead - standing tasks first

---

## Multi-Model Support Configuration - IN PROGRESS

**Discovery**: Gateway requires agent-level model allowlists (not global defaults)

**Invalid Fields Found**: 
- `agents.defaults.subagents.allowlist` (doesn't exist in schema)
- `spawnModels` (doesn't exist in schema)

**Valid Approach**:
- `agents.defaults.models`: Define model catalog with aliases
- `agents.list[].subagents.allowAgents`: Agent-level allowlists for model spawning

**Status**: First config patch failed with "invalid config" error, schema retrieved, next attempt will use agent-level configuration

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Code generation stays on BRAIN** - Jonathan's directive overrides cost optimization
2. **Weekend cron jobs disabled** - Mon-Fri only, family time protected
3. **YouTube = Primary Ministry Platform** - Longform Bible + Business, Instagram/Reels secondary
4. **Priority queue locked** - No jumping, standing tasks first
5. **Smith Letter format confirmed** - 6 stories, operator-focused analysis

---

## Files Created/Updated This Session

- `memory/model-routing-rules.md` (3.9KB)
- `memory/credentials/openai.env` (OpenAI API key)
- `memory/smith-letter-research-feb17.md` (8.5KB)
- `/Users/alfred/Desktop/smith-letter-research-feb17.md` (copy for easy access)

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Immediate**: Fix multi-model configuration using agent-level approach
2. LinkedIn posts 1-3 (reverse prompt approach)
3. YouTube Episode 1 outline
4. Mission Control nav rebuild (tonight while Jonathan sleeps)
5. Approvals Queue build (tomorrow)

---

## Session Metrics

**Time Period**: 11:47 AM - ~1:00 PM (afternoon session)  
**Major Deliverables**: 3 (Smith Letter research, Cost optimization plan, YouTube strategy)  
**Critical Decisions**: 5 (see above)  
**Files Created**: 4  
**API Optimization Plan**: 61% cost reduction approved
