# Memory Log — February 17, 2026 (Afternoon)

## SC Operations Manual — Complete Rewrite (11:22 AM - 11:46 AM)

### Context
Jonathan identified critical flaw in morning's campaign calendar: I optimized for response rate (vanity metric) instead of deals closed (real metric).

### The Correction (Scout's Insight)
**VA Beach case study:**
- 9.28% response rate (10x better than average)
- ZERO deals ratified
- High engagement ≠ deal production

**This flipped the entire strategy.**

### Team-Approved Hierarchy (Final)
Jonathan consulted with team and established priority order:
1. **MD** → Most deals ratified (lead market)
2. **DC** → Second priority (deal producer)
3. **Richmond** → Third priority (efficient converter)
4. **NOVA** → Fourth priority (support volume)
5. **VA Beach** → Last priority (paused for diagnostic)

### Send Rate Hierarchy (Deal-Driven)
- MD: 8/min (MOST AGGRESSIVE — earns it via deal production)
- DC: 6/min (second priority)
- Richmond: 5/min (third priority)
- NOVA: 4/min (fourth priority)
- VA Beach: PAUSED (investigate why 9.28% response produced zero deals)

### Volume Allocation (4-Week Sprint)
| Market | Total Texts | % of Volume |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| MD | 63,670 | 61% |
| DC | ~25,000 | 24% |
| Richmond | 13,277 | 13% |
| NOVA | 24,840 | 2% |
| VA Beach | 0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | **~104K** | **100%** |

### DC Operational Constraint (Added 11:45 AM)
**⚠️ DC = WHOLESALE/DISPO ONLY**

**Why:**
- Crew constraint due to ICE enforcement activity
- Cannot execute fix-and-flip or BRRR in DC
- Acquisition deals require construction crews (currently unavailable)

**Implementation:**
- Tom continues pursuing DC deals (still #2 priority)
- All DC deals tagged in GHL as "DC-Wholesale"
- Underwriting focus: Quick flip margin (not rehab ARV)
- Do NOT ratify deals requiring construction/rehab
- Resume acquisitions when crew situation stabilizes

**Impact:**
- DC still contributes to volume targets
- Wholesale closings = faster velocity (30-45 days vs 6-12 months BRRR)
- May actually improve overall deal velocity

### VA Beach Diagnostic Plan (Added to Manual)
**Status:** PAUSED (not permanently killed)

**8-Step Investigation:**
1. Message angle mismatch (attracting curious agents, not deal senders)
2. Market characteristics (vacation market = different psychology)
3. Qualification issue (LM rejecting submitted properties)
4. Timing/seasonality (February = low season for vacation rentals)
5. Pull all VA Beach submissions from GHL (last 3 months)
6. Review LM rejection reasons
7. 1,000-agent pilot test in March (if findings warrant)
8. Fix or kill (don't scale empty conversations)

### Section 2 Complete Rewrite
**What changed:**
- OLD: NOVA lead (6/min), VA Beach surge (8/min), MD conservative (4/min)
- NEW: MD lead (8/min), DC second (6/min), Richmond third (5/min), NOVA fourth (4/min), VA Beach paused

**4-Week Sprint Structure:**
- Week 1: MD + DC initial (top 2 priorities parallel)
- Week 2: MD FU1 + Richmond initial + DC FU1
- Week 3: MD FU2 + NOVA initial start
- Week 4: NOVA completion + Richmond FU1 + DC FU2

**Philosophy shift:**
- From: "Chase response rate"
- To: "Optimize for deals per 1,000 texts sent"

**Scout's quote:** "Response rate without deals = wasted send volume. Fix or kill, but don't scale empty conversations."

### Executive Summary Updated
Added:
- Team-approved hierarchy (MD → DC → Richmond → NOVA → VA Beach)
- Deal-driven optimization (not response rate)
- DC wholesale-only constraint (crew limitation)
- VA Beach diagnostic plan (pause and investigate)
- Projected 6-8 ratifications per sprint (maintains pace)

### Implementation Roadmap Updated
Added to Week 1:
- Execute team-approved hierarchy
- Tag all DC deals as "DC-Wholesale" in GHL
- Wholesale/dispo only until crew situation resolves

### Missing Data Point
**DC agent count:** Need this from Jonathan to finalize Week 1 volumes and DC follow-up timing.

### SC Campaign Log Deployed
**Status:** LIVE and operational

**What happened:**
- Google Sheet created: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CktoY4AGF7IS2UipUx1qllpVLttZwCoGq_yaRDig_wQ/edit
- CSV template sent to Jonathan via Telegram
- Jonathan manually imported (Chrome relay unstable)
- 6 historical campaigns logged (Weeks 1-3 backfilled)

**Template structure:**
- 17 columns tracking all campaign metrics
- Campaign naming convention embedded: `MARKET-YEAR-W##-TYPE-V#`
- Attribution system operational (VA logs every response going forward)

**Historical data captured:**
- Week 1: 72 off-markets, 3 ratifications, 1 closed ($17K)
- Week 2: 42 off-markets, 2 ratifications
- Week 3: 16 off-markets, 2 ratifications

### Reminders Set
- **March 3, 9:00 AM:** Follow up with Raymond (2-week reminder from Feb 17)

### Current Status
**SC Operations Manual:** COMPLETE and battle-ready
- 108KB total
- 10 core sections + 8 appendices
- Team-approved hierarchy implemented
- DC operational constraint documented
- VA Beach diagnostic plan included
- All 20 message variants ready to deploy
- Attribution system live
- Ready to launch Sprint 1 Week 1 (MD + DC parallel)

**What's needed to launch:**
1. DC agent count (for exact Week 1 volume calculations)
2. Jonathan's approval to begin Sprint 1
3. VA training on campaign naming (Jonathan handling this)

## Key Lessons Learned

**1. Response rate is a vanity metric**
VA Beach proved this: 9.28% response but zero deals. Don't optimize for engagement — optimize for deals per 1,000 texts sent.

**2. Let the data reveal the hierarchy**
Team knows which markets produce deals better than any algorithm or assumption. Trust their experience: MD → DC → Richmond → NOVA.

**3. Constraints are features, not bugs**
DC wholesale-only constraint may actually IMPROVE velocity (30-45 day wholesale close vs 6-12 month BRRR). Adapt strategy to constraints.

**4. Pause ≠ Kill**
VA Beach paused for investigation (not permanently deleted). Diagnostic approach: understand WHY before abandoning. 9.28% response could be valuable if we fix the conversion issue.

**5. Attribution unlocks optimization**
Can't improve what you don't measure. SC Campaign Log (deployed today) will reveal which specific campaigns/variants produce deals. Retire losers, double down on winners.

## Tomorrow's Priorities (Jonathan's Choice)

Standing by for next task. Options presented:
1. VA Beach campaign analysis (diagnostic deep-dive)
2. LinkedIn posts 1-3 (draft for approval)
3. YouTube Episode 1 outline ("I Built an AI Council")
4. Finalize "Why Men Stay Stuck" script (need hook choice A/B/C)
5. Prep Friday Board Meeting early (council analysis Thursday night)

Jonathan chose to stand down on SC for today. Awaiting next assignment.
