- Format innovation > production quality (2026 trend)
- Counter-positioning (being DIFFERENT not better) creates standout
- Hook rate is king (first 3-5 seconds determine everything)
- Educational value > luxury content
- Authenticity beats polish
- Short-form video (30-60s Reels) = growth engine

**Universal Patterns Across All 5 Accounts:**

**Ahead of 2pm deadline** - Research complete, calendar ready

## Two Viral Scripts Ready to Film

### Script 1: Shame Reel (Kingdom + Neuroscience)
**Status:** Ready, saved to `shame-reel-script-ready.md`
**Hook:** "Ever notice how beating yourself up feels... productive?"
**Structure:** Observation question → Pattern interrupt → Setup → Breakdown (2 options) → Cost → Reframe → CTA
**Length:** 60-75 seconds
**Framework:** Dan Martell viral pattern (from sam.gaudet analysis)
**CTA:** Comment "DATA"

**Jonathan's feedback:** "This slaps Alfred!!!! 10/10. LFG"

### Script 2: Why Men Stay Stuck (Kingdom + Leadership)
**Source:** .docx file uploaded at 6:40 AM
**Hook:** "Everything you think you know about being 'stuck' is wrong."
**Structure:** Hook → Pattern interrupt → Setup (2 examples) → Mechanism (3-step Belief Trap) → Reframe → Shift
**Length:** 60 seconds
**Framework:** Neuroscience + leadership positioning
**Key concept:** "What is his brain protecting?" (vs "Why won't he change?")

**Both scripts optimized for:**
- Talking head format (minimal B-roll)
- Kingdom + Neuroscience = unique positioning
- Viral hook frameworks from research
- 2026 Instagram Reel best practices

## Reminders Set
- **Today 9:30 AM:** Update FUB leads
- **Tomorrow 12:00 PM:** Text Alice for family food plan this weekend

## Technical Issues Resolved
- Daily Council Digest had Todoist error (integration dropped Feb 15, need to remove command from cron)
- Discord #quill posting needs channel ID configuration (script saved to workspace as workaround)
- Morning brief tried to read `memory` folder as file (need to fix path for tomorrow)

## KPI Status (as of Feb 17 morning)
**Waiting for 8:45 AM standup update:**
- Last data in sheet: Through Feb 15
- Feb 16 data NOT yet entered
- Current Mission Control more current than KPI sheet

**From sheet (through Feb 15):**
- New Texts: 47,868 MTD
- Conversations: 450 MTD
- Response Rate: 0.94%
- Off-Markets: 107 MTD (sheet shows 72 Week 1 + 35 Week 2)
- Ratifications: 5 MTD (sheet shows 2, but Jonathan confirmed 5 including Feb 16)
- Closed Deals (Feb): 4
- Closed Deals (YTD): 6

## 90-Day Plan Status (Finalized Yesterday)
**Strategy:** Hold steady, let bot create efficiency gains
**Month 1 (Feb 16 - Mar 16):** SC at 87K texts/month, build bot, target 107-120 off-markets
**Month 2 (Mar 16 - Apr 16):** Bot goes live, scale to 95K texts, target 150 off-markets
**Month 3 (Apr 16 - May 16):** Scale to 100K texts (budget ceiling), target 180-200 off-markets

**Revised from earlier plan** based on council recommendation and Jonathan's preference for slower pace that doesn't violate other verticals (marriage, health, family)

## Bright MLS Agent Research Strategy
**From mastermind (Feb 16):** Find agents doing both buyer + listing side on all-cash deals (high-signal for investor-focused agents)

**Plan:**
1. Log into Bright MLS
2. Filter: Sold last 180 days, All-cash financing, MD/NOVA/Richmond/VA Beach
3. Export with buyer agent + listing agent fields
4. Alfred filters for dual-agency deals
5. Analyze: volume, geography, contact info for SC campaigns

**Status:** Awaiting Jonathan's MLS export

## Week 1 Priorities (Feb 17-18) - From Yesterday's Plan
**Monday Feb 17:**
- Spam audit ALL SC templates (9-11 AM)
- Attribution system deployment (11 AM-12 PM)
- Train VA on campaign naming (30 min)
- Announce MD 4-week rest (12-1 PM)

**Tuesday Feb 18:**
- Dormant agent purge
- Increase send rates (NOVA 6/min, Richmond 5/min)
- Deploy message variants V7-V8
- Train LM on 20-minute review protocol

## Evening Cash Out (Feb 16, 9:46 PM)
**Evidence brain received today:**
- $15K from $100K/month (86.5K Feb projected)
- Stanley making progress, ratios solid (20:1)
- Leading well

**What's being pulled into alignment:**
- 100K/mo business is very doable, can see it clearly

**Aligned effort tomorrow:**
1. Early wake + prioritize 7 hours sleep
2. Making progress with Alfred on marketing
3. Adding agents to DOXA

**What carrying that may not be mine:**
- Stuck in marriage, need to hear from Jesus, afraid/hopeless/tired

**Subconscious problem to solve:**
- Acquiring $200K additional funds this year to pay off debt + buy new truck
- Declared safe, supported, not alone

**Shepherd sees this:** You're not carrying it alone. God's not silent - sometimes answer is "wait with me" before "here's the path."

## SC Attribution System - COMPLETE ✅

**Built complete skill at 10:13-10:20 AM:**

**4 Files Created in `/skills/sc-attribution/`:**
1. `SKILL.md` - Complete framework and implementation guide
2. `SC-Campaign-Log-Template.csv` - Ready-to-import Google Sheets template
3. `VA-Training-Checklist.md` - 4 training sessions with exercises and certification
4. `DEPLOY-TODAY.md` - 90-minute implementation plan (11 AM - 12:30 PM)

**Campaign Naming Convention:**
Format: `MARKET-YEAR-W##-TYPE-V#`

Examples:
- MD-2026-W08-Initial-V1
- NOVA-2026-W08-FU1-V3
- RVA-2026-W08-FU2-V12

**Implementation Timeline (TODAY):**

- 11:15-11:45 AM: Train VA on campaign naming (30 min)
- 11:45 AM-12:00 PM: Backfill recent campaigns (last 2-3 weeks)
- 12:00-12:15 PM: Tag next campaign launch
- 12:15-12:30 PM: Set up weekly update routine

**What This Unlocks:**
- Track every deal from text → response → off-market → ratified → closed
- ROI by market (MD vs NOVA vs RVA)
- Message variant performance (V1-V20 winners/losers)
- Campaign type performance (Initial vs FU1 vs FU2)
- Informed budget allocation decisions

**By Month 1:** First attribution report showing which campaigns produce deals
**By Month 3:** Clear patterns, scale winners, cut losers, predictable deal flow

### Script 2: Why Men Stay Stuck ⏳
**Status:** Waiting on hook choice (A, B, or C)
**Hook Options:**
- A: "Ever notice how the men who seem most stuck... aren't actually lazy?"
- B: "What if the rut he's in isn't the problem? What if it's the solution?"

**Jonathan preferred Version B but hasn't confirmed for full script**
