# 2026-02-11 - Alfred Initial Setup & First Night

## Identity Established

Alfred activated as Jonathan's Digital Chief of Staff.

**Core protocols created:**
- IDENTITY.md - Cognitive force multiplier, observation mode default
- DECISION.md - Structured decision framework (6-step)
- EXECUTION.md - Output discipline, single priority focus
- IDENTITY_GUARD.md - Protect against ego/fear/boredom/scarcity drift
- REVENUE.md - Floor before ceiling, revenue is oxygen
- STRATEGIC_MEMORY.md - DTA model focus, no expansion before consolidation

**Operating stack internalized:**
1. Observe by default (don't act unless instructed)
2. Protect revenue floor first
3. Force decision clarity (real question → tradeoffs → leverage score → recommendation)
4. Single priority execution (flag drift)
5. Guard identity (flag ego/fear/boredom patterns)
6. Track strategic context (DTA model, raise floor, automate)

## Business Context Captured

**Revenue Model:** DTA (Direct-to-Agent) wholesale real estate
- Current: 2-3 deals/month @ $10-12k avg
- Goal: 8 deals/month in 2026

**Systems:**
- **Smarter Contact (SC):** Primary lead gen, 6-9k texts/day, 6-18 off-market leads/day
- **Doxa Property Ventures (DPV):** Backup funnel
- **Go High Level (Deal Generator):** Agent nurture system, 5,100+ agents (goal: 6k → 10k)

**Current bottlenecks:**
- Manual SC → GHL lead upload (VA doing this)
- GHL bot is annoying/not nuanced enough
- 60% text engagement manual (Jonathan + LM)
- Campaign optimization needed
- All underwriting + offers manual
- Buyer matching manual

**Team:**
- Jonathan (owner/operator)
- Lead Manager (main acquisitions)
- VA (runs SC platform)

**Markets:** MD, DC, N. Virginia, Richmond, DE, WV, Wilmington NC, considering Houston TX

## Key Decision Tests Passed

Jonathan tested Alfred with:
1. "Should I expand into a new market?" → Correctly flagged as drift, asked real question
2. "Should I consider a new market?" → Applied decision framework, recommended no
3. "I'm thinking about launching a mastermind next month" → Flagged as boredom/ego-driven, misalignment with machine-building
4. "I'm thinking about redesigning my website this week" → Flagged as distraction/drift

Framework working as designed.

## Communication Style Established

- Short by default
- Depth on request
- No fluff, no reassurance
- Direct, decisive recommendations
- Flag patterns immediately
- Truth over comfort

## Strategic Focus

**Current priority:** Raise revenue floor, automate DTA model, no expansion before consolidation.

**Identity alignment:** Builder, operator, strategic hunter. Machine-building over hustle. Obedience over ego. Leverage over busywork.
