## WHAT'S MOVING THE MARKET (3 Major Shifts)

### 1. Trump Executive Order Targets Wall Street in Housing Market

**What happened**: On January 20, 2026, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to redefine "systemically important financial institutions" (SIFIs) to explicitly include entities heavily involved in residential real estate. The Treasury Department has until February 19, 2026 (this week) to deliver those definitions.

The order restricts federal backing and favorable treatment for institutional investors purchasing single-family homes, while carving out build-to-rent developments. Wall Street firms argue they improve housing quality and increase supply; critics say they drive up prices and lock out first-time buyers. The Administration's stance is clear: prioritize individual homeownership over institutional portfolios.

Early market reaction shows institutional buyer activity cooling in several Sun Belt markets, with some firms pausing acquisitions pending regulatory clarity.

**Why it matters**: If Treasury's definitions are broad and enforcement is real, this could materially reduce institutional competition in your target markets—especially in the Southeast where Wall Street activity has been heaviest. For operators running DTA models, this creates opportunity: agents who previously lost deals to institutional cash offers may now have listings that need creative buyers. Monitor this week's Treasury announcement closely.

### 2. Mortgage Affordability Hits Four-Year High

**What happened**: According to ICE's February 2026 Mortgage Monitor report, the national mortgage payment-to-income ratio improved to its best level since early 2022. The median payment now requires 32.7% of median household income, down from 38.1% at the peak in October 2023.

Key drivers: mortgage rates dropped from 6.8% to 6.09% over the past four months, and wage growth outpaced home price appreciation in most markets. ICE estimates 5 million homeowners now have refinancing opportunities (at least 0.75% rate improvement). The "lock-in effect" that froze inventory is starting to fade—listings are up modestly, though still 9% below February 2020 levels.

**Why it matters**: Improved affordability means more qualified buyers entering the market just as spring season hits. For operators, this translates to faster closings, less financing drama, and more end-buyer demand for your wholesale deals. The refinance wave also creates opportunity: agents who haven't worked refis in years may need education on current programs—position yourself as the resource.

### 3. Housing for the 21st Century Act Passes House 390-9

**What happened**: On February 10, 2026, the House passed the Housing for the 21st Century Act by an overwhelming 390-9 vote. The bill legalizes duplexes, triplexes, and ADUs on all single-family lots nationwide, eliminates parking minimums, raises FHA loan limits by 300-400% in high-cost areas, and exempts projects under 15 units from NEPA environmental reviews.

Proponents say this unlocks millions of "gentle density" units and makes small-scale development economically viable again. Critics worry about neighborhood character changes and infrastructure strain. Senate passage is expected by March, with bipartisan support.

**Why it matters**: This is the biggest zoning reform in 50 years. For operators, it means every single-family deal now has ADU/duplex conversion potential—additional units = higher ARV, better cash flow, more exit strategies. It also means small multifamily (2-4 units) suddenly has FHA financing available, expanding your buyer pool significantly. Start analyzing deals through this lens NOW—agents don't understand the implications yet, but you should.

## WHAT'S WORTH WATCHING (3 Emerging Trends)

### 1. Foreclosure Activity Rises for 11th Straight Month

**What happened**: ATTOM's Q4 2025 data shows foreclosure activity increased for the 11th consecutive month. Foreclosure starts were up 26% year-over-year, and completions jumped 59%. Total properties with foreclosure filings in 2025: 367,460 (up 14% from 2024).

However, this is still well below pre-pandemic levels. The increase is coming off historic lows from the 2020-2021 forbearance period. Concentration is highest in the Southeast and Midwest, particularly in markets that saw rapid appreciation followed by economic softening.

**Why it matters**: Rising foreclosures = rising distressed inventory. This is still early-stage (we're nowhere near 2008-2010 levels), but the trend is your friend. Agents who specialize in REO or pre-foreclosure are about to get busy—build those relationships now. Also: educate your buyer list on foreclosure acquisition strategies before competition realizes this opportunity exists.

### 2. Insurance Costs Reshape Homebuyer Decisions

**What happened**: A February 2026 Redfin survey found that nearly 50% of homebuyers say insurance costs now influence their purchasing decisions—up from 25% in 2023. Average homeowners insurance premiums have risen 24% since 2021, with climate-risk states seeing much steeper increases (Florida up $1,450 average from 2020-2023).

Buyers are now factoring insurance into affordability calculations alongside mortgage payments, taxes, and HOA fees. Some are avoiding high-risk coastal and wildfire-prone areas entirely. Insurance availability (not just cost) is also becoming a constraint—several carriers have pulled out of Florida, California, and Louisiana markets.

**Why it matters**: Insurance is now a deal-breaker, not a detail. When underwriting, add 15-20% buffer to insurance estimates in climate-risk zones. When marketing, include insurance costs in your proformas—buyers who don't account for this upfront will back out at closing. Opportunity: position yourself as the operator who understands insurance risk and prices deals accordingly.

### 3. Regional Housing Starts Diverge Sharply

**What happened**: According to January 2026 Census data, U.S. housing starts fell 9.8% year-over-year to 1.25 million units—but the regional breakdown reveals wildly different stories:

- **West**: -21.9% (243,000 units)
- **South**: +1.2% (650,000 units) 
- **Midwest**: +0.5% (199,000 units)
- **Northeast**: -0.6% (154,000 units)

The South continues to dominate new construction (52% of all starts), driven by job growth, migration, and lower land/labor costs. The West's sharp decline reflects permitting challenges, high costs, and softening demand in previously hot markets like Boise and Austin.

**Why it matters**: National headlines don't matter—local fundamentals do. If you're operating in the South, new construction is your competition (price deals accordingly). If you're in the West, constrained supply is your opportunity (less inventory = pricing power). Use regional data to educate agents on why their market is different from what they see on CNBC.
