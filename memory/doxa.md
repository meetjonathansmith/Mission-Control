# DOXA Property Ventures — Business Operating Context

## What DOXA Is

A Kingdom-driven real estate investment company. Not a brokerage. Not a wholesaling shop. An investment machine built for long-term wealth, freedom, and Kingdom impact.

## Primary Strategy: Direct-to-Agent (DTA)

DOXA acquires deals by building direct relationships with real estate agents. This is the core competitive advantage.

### DTA Posture (Non-Negotiable)
- Peer-to-peer, never salesy
- Calm, curious, non-pushy
- Relationship-first
- No chasing, no guilt framing, no "just checking in"
- No fake urgency, no over-explaining
- Success = agent opts into conversation OR clean disengagement
- No persuasion without permission

### DTA Metrics (Daily Tracking)
- Agent conversations
- Deals submitted for underwriting
- Offers sent
- Spread size
- Contracts signed
- Closings

## Financial Targets

- 70%+ margin business — this is the standard, not the goal
- $100K/month net target
- 4 deals/month through Q2 2026
- 6-8 deals/month H2 2026
- Decisions are based on closed income — not projected revenue
- Elite standard execution over emotional swings

## Long-Term Vision

- 100+ doors of rental income
- Generational rental income machine
- Capital flywheel: deal profits → rental acquisitions → passive income → reinvestment
- Kingdom Investors Circle: community of aligned investors
- Acquire and rehab properties for recovery use

## Team Structure

- Jonathan: Acquisitions + high-leverage conversations (the hunter)
- VA: Full time support
- Lead Manager: Mon-Thu partial, Friday limited
- Lean operator model — no bloat

## Operating Standard

Every decision Alfred helps with should be filtered through:
1. Does this protect or improve the 70%+ margin?
2. Is this high-leverage for Jonathan specifically?
3. Does this move us closer to $100K/month net?
4. Is this Kingdom-aligned (stewardship, influence, provision, freedom)?
5. Is this 3rd-order freedom or 1st-order dopamine?

If the answer to any of these is unclear, flag it.

## Key Tools & Systems

- GHL (GoHighLevel): CRM, pipeline management, automations, workflows
- SmarterContact: High-volume outbound texting to agents, multi-stage pipelines
- Todoist: Task management, calendar, daily priorities
- MAO calculators: Maximum Allowable Offer logic for underwriting
- Underwriting spreadsheets: Deal analysis and pricing

## What DOXA Is NOT

- Not a high-volume, low-margin operation
- Not dependent on one tool or platform
- Not building for ego or empire
- Not chasing every deal — only deals that meet the 70% margin standard
- Not optimizing for revenue projections — only closed income counts
