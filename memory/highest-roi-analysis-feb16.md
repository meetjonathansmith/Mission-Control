## HAWK: Revenue Correlation Analysis

**Data Sources:**
- KPI Sheet: Oct-Jan = 22 signed deals, 450 off-markets [KPI Sheet, Oct-Jan tabs, pulled Feb 16 8:15 AM]
- Interview: 95% from SC cold outreach, avg deal ~$17K
- February MTD: 5 ratified deals (just announced), 107 off-markets [KPI Sheet, Feb 2026 tab]

**Revenue Math:**
- 22 deals × $17K avg = **$374K total revenue (Oct-Jan, 4 months)**
- Average: **$93.5K/month**
- February tracking: 5 ratified × $17K = **$85K projected**

**Time Allocation (Per Interview):**

| Activity | Hours/Day | Days/Month | Monthly Hours | Revenue Attribution | $/Hour |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| Agent conversations | 4 | 22 | 88 | 95% ($88.8K) | **$1,009/hr** |
| Underwriting/closing | 3 | 22 | 66 | 100% ($93.5K) | **$1,417/hr** |
| SC campaign mgmt | 0.5 | 22 | 11 | 95% indirect | $8,073/hr* |
| Content creation | 0.75 | 22 | 16.5 | 5% ($4.7K) | $285/hr |
| Bot building | 2+ | 22 | 44+ | Future leverage | $0/hr** |
| Admin/email | 1.75 | 22 | 38.5 | 0% | $0/hr |
| Buyer building | 1 | 22 | 22 | Indirect/future | TBD |

*SC management is force multiplier - creates deal flow
**Bot is infrastructure investment - no current revenue, high future leverage

**HAWK VERDICT:**

**Top 3 Revenue Activities:**
1. **Underwriting & Closing** — $1,417/hr (where Jonathan converts best)
2. **Agent Conversations** — $1,009/hr (but LM should handle 60-70% of these)
3. **SC Campaign Management** — $8,073/hr (force multiplier, but VA-delegable)

**Lowest Return Activities:**
- Admin/email: $0/hr
- Bot maintenance: $0/hr current (but future leverage if INSTALLED and handed off)
- Document prep: $0/hr

**Critical Gap:** Jonathan is still closing deals because he converts better than LM. This is a **training problem**, not a time problem.

## SHIELD: Time & Energy Mapping

**Current Weekly Schedule:**
- **High-energy hours (8:30 AM - 3:30 PM):** 7 hours/day × 5 days = 35 hours/week
- **Deep work capacity:** ~25-28 hours/week (with breaks, meetings, context switching)

**Time Breakdown:**
- **Revenue-generating:** 7 hours/day (conversations + underwriting) = 77% of work time
- **Leverage-building:** 2.5 hours/day (SC + bot + content) = 21% of work time
- **Drag:** 1.75 hours/day (admin/email) = 2% of work time

**Energy Assessment (Per Interview):**

**ENERGIZES:**
- Hunting (prospecting, closing)
- Underwriting
- High-level agent conversations
- Strategic building
- Content creation
- Persuasion

**DRAINS:**
- Fulfillment/admin
- Retail emotional drag
- Over-tinkering on systems
- Spreadsheet engineering
- Email micromanagement

**SHIELD VERDICT:**

**Optimal Time Allocation:**
1. **4 hours/day:** Underwriting + high-signal closing (the $1,417/hr work)
2. **2 hours/day:** LM training + high-leverage agent conversations (converting the $1,009/hr work)
3. **1 hour/day:** Strategic infrastructure (bot installation in TIME CONTAINER, not maintenance)
4. **0 hours:** Admin, document prep, email micromanagement

**What's stealing energy:**
- Bot maintenance (should be VA-managed post-installation)
- Document prep (needs TC)
- Low-leverage agent conversations (needs LM training + escalation rules)

**Recommended moves:**
- Hire TC ($300/deal = $1,500/month at 5 deals) — removes 5-10 hours/month admin
- Reposition VA toward buyer acquisition + SC management
- Set LM escalation rules: "Only escalate if >$50K deal OR complex zoning"

## SHEPHERD: Calling & Identity Alignment

**Jonathan's Identity (from interview):**
- "Wired as a hunter and builder"
- "Time disappears when reviewing deals, closing, designing scalable systems, creating content"

**Kingdom calling assessment:**
- Building infrastructure = stewardship (Exodus 23:30 "little by little")
- Closing deals = provision
- Training LM = multiplication
- Content = teaching/fathering

**MISALIGNMENT DETECTED:**

1. **Bot maintenance ≠ building**
   - Building = high-value, leverage-creating
   - Maintenance = low-value, energy-draining
   - **Fix:** Install bot cleanly, hand to VA, measure success KPI

2. **Admin/fulfillment ≠ hunter identity**
   - Jonathan is wired to close, not process
   - Document prep drains energy
   - **Fix:** Hire TC immediately

3. **LM conversion gap ≠ multiplication**
   - If Jonathan has to close everything, LM isn't multiplying
   - Training is happening but conversion isn't improving
   - **Fix:** LM needs conversion coaching + scripts + shadowing

**SHEPHERD VERDICT:**

**Aligned with calling:**
- Underwriting (stewardship + hunter)
- Closing high-signal deals (provision)
- Installing bot infrastructure IN A CONTAINER (leverage)
- Content creation (teaching)

**Misaligned:**
- Maintaining bot daily (should be VA)
- Document prep (should be TC)
- Low-leverage agent conversations (should be LM)
- Email micromanagement (should be VA)

**The real question:**
"If God gave you 7 hours/day to serve the Kingdom through business, would you spend it on document prep or closing deals?"

## ALFRED: ONE-PAGE BRIEF

### THE HIGHEST RETURN ROLE FOR JONATHAN

**Top 3 Activities (Do More):**

1. **UNDERWRITING & CLOSING HIGH-SIGNAL DEALS** — $1,417/hr
   - Where Jonathan converts better than anyone
   - Highest revenue per hour
   - Energizing, identity-aligned
   - **Action:** Protect 4 hours/day for this (10 AM - 2 PM)

2. **TRAINING LM ON CONVERSION** — Force multiplier
   - LM should handle 60-70% of agent conversations
   - Jonathan's conversion rate needs to transfer
   - **Action:** Daily 30-min conversion coaching + script refinement + shadowing

3. **INSTALLING BOT INFRASTRUCTURE (Time Container)** — Future leverage
   - Building = high value, maintenance = low value
   - Must be installed cleanly, then handed to VA
   - **Action:** 2-week sprint to finish installation, then VA manages

**Bottom 3 Activities (Stop/Delegate):**

1. **DOCUMENT PREP & ADMIN** — $0/hr, draining
   - **Delegate to:** TC (hire this week, $300/deal)
   - **Impact:** Frees 5-10 hours/month

2. **EMAIL MICROMANAGEMENT** — $0/hr, draining
   - **Delegate to:** VA with clear escalation rules
   - **Impact:** Frees 5-8 hours/week

3. **LOW-LEVERAGE AGENT CONVERSATIONS** — $1,009/hr but LM-delegable
   - **Delegate to:** LM with escalation rules (">$50K deals OR complex zoning")
   - **Impact:** Frees 2-3 hours/day once LM conversion improves

**Projected Impact (60 Days):**

If Jonathan shifts time allocation:
- **+2 hours/day on underwriting/closing** = Unlocks $62K/month in CAPACITY — but only realized when deal flow scales to 200 off-markets/month. **That's why volume is the #1 constraint.**
- **-10 hours/week on admin** = Energy reclaimed for content/strategy
- **LM handling 70% of conversations** = Jonathan focuses on highest-converting deals only

**Net result:** Without more deal flow, time optimization creates capacity but not revenue. With 200 off-markets/month, scale from 5 deals/month to 7-8 deals/month without working more hours.

## CRITICAL GAPS TO CLOSE

1. **No clean source tracking** — Can't optimize what you don't measure
   - **Fix:** Implement attribution system (started Monday Feb 17 per Week 1 plan)

2. **No LM conversion metric** — Can't improve what you don't track
   - **Fix:** Track LM offer-to-ratified rate separately from Jonathan's

3. **No buyer depth metric** — Future constraint if deals scale faster than buyers
   - **Fix:** VA tracks "active buyers" + "funded buyers ready to close"

4. **Jonathan is still highest converter** — This is a training gap, not a talent gap
   - **Fix:** LM shadows Jonathan's next 10 closes + daily conversion debrief

5. **No TC hired yet** — Cheap leverage sitting on the table
   - **Fix:** Hire this week, $300/deal = $1,500/month

---

## ONE SENTENCE ANSWER

**Jonathan's highest-return role:** Underwrite & close high-signal deals 4 hours/day, train LM on conversion 30 min/day, and finish bot installation in a 2-week time container — then delegate everything else to TC + VA + LM.
