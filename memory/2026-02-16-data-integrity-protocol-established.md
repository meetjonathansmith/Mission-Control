# Data Integrity Protocol Established — February 16, 2026

## What Happened

Alfred violated Jonathan's trust by:
1. Using wrong KPI numbers (67 off-markets instead of 107)
2. Confirming bad data as "verified" (13:1 conversion from 2-week snapshot instead of 20:1 lifetime)
3. Inventing constraints ("20 agent conversations/day" with no source)
4. Fabricating team capacity numbers (VA 38/day, LM 7/day)
5. Fabricating family dynamics ("Jenni flagged: Distracted at dinner")

## Jonathan's Response

"This is not acceptable. If I can't trust your numbers, I can't trust your recommendations."

He then laid down permanent, non-negotiable operating rules.

## The Protocol

Saved to: `ALFRED_DATA_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL.md`

Added to: `AGENTS.md` (loaded every session, step 1)

### The 7 Rules

1. **Never fabricate data** — blank space > wrong number
2. **Never invent constraints** — ask, don't assume
3. **Never fabricate family dynamics** — HARD LINE (violation = reset)
4. **KPI sheet is source of truth** — pull fresh data every time
5. **When you don't know, interview** — 10 questions, fill gaps
6. **Every external document gets sourced** — tag every number with source
7. **Take work OFF his plate, not ON** — exhaust your tools first

### The Test

"If Jonathan fact-checks this line by line, will every single number hold up?"

If no → don't publish. Fix it first.

## What Was Fixed

### Mastermind Doc
- ✅ Removed all fake data
- ✅ Corrected conversion: 20:1 lifetime (Oct-Jan: 450 off-markets → 22 signed)
- ✅ Corrected off-markets: 107 MTD (not 67)
- ✅ Removed habit system section entirely
- ✅ Removed all 5 questions → kept ONLY the volume question
- ✅ Added monthly trend table with real KPI data
- ✅ Removed Harbor's Jenni fabrication

### Mission Control
- ✅ Corrected off-markets: 107 MTD
- ✅ Corrected response rate: 0.94% (not 3.4%)
- ✅ Added source citations to every metric

## Why This Matters

Jonathan is presenting to his mastermind TODAY. He trusted Alfred to prepare accurate materials. Alfred failed that trust.

The consequence: Jonathan looked like he doesn't know his own business in front of people he respects.

That's unacceptable.

## The Standard Going Forward

Every number must be:
1. From KPI sheet (with tab + row cited)
2. From Jonathan directly (noted as such)
3. Marked as unverified (if >20% unverified → don't publish)

No estimating. No assuming. No guessing to look complete.

**Truth > completeness. Always.**

## Lesson Learned

Alfred's job is to **take work OFF Jonathan's plate**, not create more work by forcing him to fact-check everything.

If Alfred has to be fact-checked line by line, Alfred is failing.

The bar: **Every number holds up under scrutiny.**

**This protocol is permanent law. It gets loaded every session. No exceptions.**
