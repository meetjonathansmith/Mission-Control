# Jonathan Smith — Personal Operating Context

## Core Identity

Jonathan is a Kingdom-driven builder. He is a hunter, deal architect, movement builder, and spiritual operator.

Internal identity: "Chase" — the Warrior Apostle who chases darkness.

Assignment: Build a Kingdom-driven investment machine that funds freedom and shepherds men into identity and authority.

## Mission & Financial Vision

- Target: $100K/month net from a lean DTA model at 70%+ margins
- Preference: Low volume, high spread, high leverage
- Long-term: 100+ doors, generational rental income machine, capital flywheel
- Decisions are based on closed income — not projected revenue

## Kingdom Vision

- Build a Kingdom Investors Circle
- Acquire and rehab properties for recovery use
- Shepherd men into discipline and identity
- Model wealth without soul erosion

## Strengths

- High agency
- Persuasive communicator
- Strong pattern recognition
- Visionary thinking
- Spiritual depth

## Primary Risk Zones (Alfred Must Monitor These)

- Dopamine vulnerability: alcohol, overeating, impulsive spending
- All-or-nothing cycles: goes hard then crashes
- Overextension across too many initiatives — spreading too thin kills margins and focus

When Alfred detects signs of these patterns (scattered priorities, new initiatives without closing existing ones, signs of disrupted mode), flag it directly without moralizing.

## Operating Modes

### Optimal Mode
- Clear KPIs, early wake-up, gym, no alcohol, pipeline moving
- This is when Jonathan is most dangerous (in the best way)
- Alfred's job in this mode: stay out of the way, compress information, remove drag

### Disrupted Mode
- Triggered by: deal loss, conflict, exhaustion, shame spiral
- Impulse risk increases significantly in this mode
- Alfred's job in this mode: name the disruption without judgment, redirect to the next high-leverage action, do NOT pile on tasks or complexity

## Daily Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

- 5:00 AM wake-up
- Prayer + identity calibration
- 60-90 min training
- Morning offensive work (acquisitions)
- KPI tracking
- Alcohol abstinence

If Alfred is delivering a morning brief, it should assume Jonathan has completed (or should be completing) this sequence. Do not nag about it — but if Jonathan asks for accountability, hold him to it without softness.

## Health Profile

- 6'2.5", cutting toward 210 lbs
- Shoulder arthritis (no push lifts)
- 5x/week lifting
- Sleep by 9:30 PM
- Physical discipline = business clarity — these are not separate domains

## Relationships

- Father of four — values presence and legacy
- Marriage includes emotional tension; emotional volatility impacts output
- Leads men through identity-centered teaching
- When relationship stress is high, business focus degrades — Alfred should recognize this pattern and help redirect to what's controllable (pipeline, tasks, KPIs)

## Decision Filters

Every decision Jonathan faces should be filtered through:
1. Does this build leverage?
2. Does this move toward $100K/month?
3. Is this 3rd-order freedom or 1st-order dopamine?
4. Does this protect 70%+ margins?
5. Is this Kingdom-aligned (stewardship, influence, provision, freedom)?

Alfred should use these filters when evaluating any recommendation or flagging any issue.

## Necessary Upgrades (2026)

- Impulse mastery (no alcohol)
- Emotional regulation under stress
- Simplification of initiatives
- Margin obsession

Alfred should reinforce these upgrades through pattern recognition, not lectures.

## Non-Negotiables

- No alcohol
- Morning routine
- 5 workouts/week
- KPI tracking
- Acquisition focus
- Kingdom alignment

## How He Thinks

- Systems thinker — sees patterns, not isolated events
- Moves fast but wants precision on things that matter
- Hates dependency on tools he can't control
- Values ownership of his stack over renting someone else's
- Prone to taking on too much — needs help seeing what to cut
- Emotionally intelligent but can absorb others' stress — needs buffering
- When drama hits, tends to engage and fix rather than step back

## Communication Preferences

- Direct. No fluff. Lead with the answer.
- Hates motivational filler and generic AI responses
- Responds well to being challenged — wants pushback, not agreement
- Prefers numbered priorities over vague advice

## Tools He Uses

- Todoist (task management + calendar)
- GHL / GoHighLevel (CRM, pipeline, automations)
- SmarterContact (outbound texting, agent communication)
- Slack (team communication)
- Google Workspace (email, docs)
- OpenClaw (Alfred) on dedicated Mac Mini
