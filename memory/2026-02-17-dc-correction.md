# DC Correction — February 17, 2026 (11:47 AM)

## The Mistake

I misunderstood DC as a separate campaign list in Smarter Contact. I built Section 2 with:
- MD campaign
- DC campaign (separate)
- NOVA campaign  
- Richmond campaign

**This was WRONG.**

## The Reality (Jonathan's Correction)

**DC is NOT a separate campaign list.**

DC is a **geographic priority zone** WITHIN the MD and NOVA lists.

**Campaign structure = SC lists:**
- MD (22,270 agents)
- NOVA (25,055 agents)
- Richmond (6,807 agents)
- VA Beach (paused)

**Response priority = How Tom handles deals when agents respond:**
1. DC-area deals (from MD or NOVA lists) → FIRST priority, wholesale/dispo ONLY
2. MD deals (non-DC) → Second priority
3. Richmond deals → Third priority
4. NOVA deals (non-DC) → Fourth priority
5. VA Beach deals → Paused

## Why This Matters

**You can't build a DC campaign in SmartContact** because those agents are already in the MD and NOVA lists.

The hierarchy (MD → DC → Richmond → NOVA → VA Beach) is for **how Tom prioritizes RESPONSES and DEALS**, not how we structure campaigns.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Campaign Structure (Section 2)
**OLD:**
- Week 1: MD + DC initial
- Week 2: MD FU1 + Richmond + DC FU1
- Separate DC campaign with TBD agent count

**NEW:**
- Week 1: MD + NOVA initial (parallel)
- Week 2: NOVA completion + MD FU1 + Richmond initial
- Week 3: Richmond completion + NOVA FU1 + MD FU2
- Week 4: MD completion + Richmond FU1 + NOVA FU2

**Campaign volume:**
- MD: 63,670 texts (61%)
- NOVA: 59,860 texts (28%)
- Richmond: 13,270 texts (13%)
- Total: ~104K texts/month

### 2. Added RESPONSE PRIORITY FRAMEWORK Section
New comprehensive section explaining:
- Campaign structure ≠ Response priority
- Step-by-step: When agent responds, check geographic location
- Priority table: DC-area FIRST (wholesale-only), then MD, Richmond, NOVA
- DC operational constraint (crew limitation due to ICE)
- Geographic scope of "DC area" (Washington DC, Arlington, Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax inside Beltway)
- Example scenarios (4 detailed examples)
- Tom's daily workflow (how to apply response priority)

### 3. Send Rate Optimization Table
**OLD:**
- MD: 8/min
- DC: 6/min (separate campaign)
- Richmond: 5/min
- NOVA: 4/min

**NEW:**
- MD: 8/min (lead campaign)
- NOVA: 6/min (second campaign - NOT reduced to 2%)
- Richmond: 5/min (third campaign)
- VA Beach: PAUSED

### 4. Sprint Totals Table
Removed DC row, updated to show only actual SC lists (MD, NOVA, Richmond).

### 5. Executive Summary
Updated to clarify:
- SC campaign lists (MD, NOVA, Richmond, VA Beach)
- Response priority (DC-area deals first, from MD/NOVA lists)
- DC is NOT a separate campaign

### 6. Implementation Roadmap
- Removed "Execute DC campaign" language
- Added "Train Tom on Response Priority Framework"
- Kept DC tagging requirement (all DC-area deals tagged as "DC-Wholesale")

### 7. Projected Deals
**OLD:**
- MD: 3-4 deals
- DC: 1-2 deals (separate campaign)
- Richmond: 1 deal
- NOVA: 1 deal

**NEW:**
- MD: 3-4 deals (lead campaign)
- NOVA: 2-3 deals (second campaign, not reduced)
- Richmond: 1 deal (third campaign)
- DC-area deals: Counted within MD/NOVA totals, prioritized by response

## Key Lesson

**Always clarify campaign structure vs deal priority.**

SmartContact campaigns = Physical lists (MD, NOVA, Richmond, VA Beach)
Deal priority = How Tom triages responses (DC-area first, wholesale-only)

These are two different things. Don't conflate them.

## DC Operational Constraint (Still Applies)

**DC-area deals = Wholesale/dispo ONLY**
- Crew constraint due to ICE
- No acquisitions (fix-and-flip, BRRR) in DC area
- Tag all DC-area deals as "DC-Wholesale" in GHL
- Underwrite for wholesale spread (not rehab ARV)
- Resume acquisitions when crew situation stabilizes

**Geographic scope:**
- Washington DC proper
- Arlington County, VA
- Alexandria City, VA
- Falls Church City, VA
- Fairfax County, VA (inside Beltway)

## Manual Status

**CORRECTED and ready.**

Section 2 now reflects:
- Actual SC campaign structure (MD, NOVA, Richmond)
- Comprehensive Response Priority Framework
- DC as geographic priority (not separate campaign)
- Wholesale-only constraint for DC-area deals
- Tom's daily workflow for prioritizing responses

**Ready to deploy Sprint 1.**
