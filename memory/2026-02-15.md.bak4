# 2026-02-15 — Council System Configuration Complete

## Major System Update: Council Digest Refinements Applied

**Status:** ACTIVE — All changes applied and saved to permanent memory

### What Was Done

1. **Complete council configuration saved** to `memory/council-config.md` (16KB)
   - All 8 advisor voice profiles fully documented
   - The Commander voice rewritten: Coherence-based coaching (neuroscience + biblical + identity-aligned)
   - ContentArchitect upgraded: Creative strategist who references ACTUAL life events, not generic advice
   - The Shepherd, The Anchor, Business advisors: Confirmed locked in

2. **MEMORY.md updated** with council summary and reference to full config

3. **Accuracy tracking system created** at `memory/council-accuracy.json`
   - Tracks recommendations, approvals, overrides, outcomes for each advisor
   - Will be integrated into Friday Board Meeting reports
   - Council learns from real outcomes over time

4. **Daily digest template created** at `memory/council-daily-template.md` (5.7KB)
   - Complete generation guidelines
   - Voice consistency notes
   - Data source references
   - Example outputs for each advisor

5. **Three cron jobs scheduled:**
   - **Daily Digest** (Mon-Thu, Sat-Sun): 7:00 AM EST → Next run: Monday Feb 17
   - **Friday Board Meeting**: 7:00 AM EST → Next run: Friday Feb 21
   - **Sunday Week Ahead**: 6:00 PM EST → Next run: **TOMORROW Sunday Feb 16**

### New Features Implemented

**Quiet Morning Mode**
- Trigger: "Quiet morning" or "Alfred — quiet morning"
- Delivers ONLY: The Shepherd's reflection + one key business number
- No full digest, no strategy — just spiritual grounding
- Can request "Send full digest" later if needed

**Feedback Loop + Accuracy Tracking**
- Trigger phrases: "Council was wrong on X", "Override", "X advisor was off"
- Logs corrections to JSON file
- Tracks advisor accuracy over time
- Friday Board Meeting includes Advisor Accuracy Section

### Key Voice Changes

**The Commander (Complete Rewrite):**
- OLD: Goggins-style coercion ("That's soft. Get after it.")
- NEW: Coherence-based coaching ("That's not who you are. What got in the way?")
- Framework: Neuroscience + Biblical truth + Identity-aligned + Coherence over coercion
- Voice: "Andrew Huberman meets a pastor who understands performance"
- Pushes from identity, not shame

**ContentArchitect (Upgrade):**
- References ACTUAL life events as content fuel
- "That deal you closed — film what almost went wrong"
- NOT generic "post about X" advice
- Authenticity beats polish

### Operating Principles Confirmed

1. 18-24:1 off-market ratio is INDUSTRY STANDARD (only diagnose if >30:1 for 2 months)
2. Deals come in clusters, not linear (evaluate ratios at month-end only)
3. Volume constraint: "Are we getting enough off-markets?" Target: 200/month
4. Coherence over coercion across ALL advisors (Pull Work, not Forcework)
5. The Shepherd has veto power on values conflicts
6. The Anchor has pushback authority on overwork
7. Christy's peace > profit. Always.

### System Go-Live Schedule

- **Tomorrow (Sunday Feb 16, 6:00 PM):** First Week Ahead Briefing delivered
- **Monday Feb 17, 7:00 AM:** Daily Digest system goes live
- **Friday Feb 21, 7:00 AM:** First Board Meeting with Advisor Accuracy tracking

### File Locations

- Full config: `memory/council-config.md` (16KB)
- Accuracy tracking: `memory/council-accuracy.json` (2.4KB)
- Daily template: `memory/council-daily-template.md` (5.7KB)
- This memory: `memory/2026-02-15.md`

## Notes

System is fully configured and ready for Monday go-live. Tomorrow evening (Sunday 6 PM) will be the first automated delivery (Week Ahead Briefing). All advisor voices updated. Accuracy tracking initialized. Cron jobs scheduled.

Jonathan's refinements were comprehensive and surgical — clarity on voice consistency (coherence over coercion), practical features (Quiet Morning Mode), and feedback loops (accuracy tracking). The council system is now a learning system, not just a reporting system.

## Council Identity Upgrade

**Time:** 2026-02-15 17:29 EST

The council now has identity. Each advisor has a name.

**Final Roster:**
- 🙏 **Shepherd** — Kingdom (spiritual, identity, veto power)
- 💪 **Atlas** — Health (coherence-based performance, neuroscience + Scripture)
- ⚓ **Harbor** — Family (marriage, kids, presence, pushback authority)
- 🦅 **Hawk** — Deal Flow (off-market volume, SC optimization, the hunter)
- 🛡️ **Shield** — Operations (sustainability, risk, list health, the protector)
- ✒️ **Quill** — Content (creative strategist, authenticity-first, Jonathan's voice)
- 🧭 **Scout** — Growth (long-game vision, expansion, asymmetric upside) [renamed from Compass 17:31 EST]
- 🤖 **Alfred** — Chief of Staff (facilitator, mediator, router)

**All Systems Updated:**
- Discord channels renamed (`#shepherd`, `#atlas`, `#harbor`, `#hawk`, `#shield`, `#quill`, `#scout`)
- `MEMORY.md` updated with new advisor names
- `memory/council-config.md` updated (16KB)
- `memory/council-daily-template.md` updated (5.7KB)
- `memory/council-accuracy.json` updated with new advisor names
- `.credentials/discord-channels.json` updated
- Identity announcements posted to all Discord channels

**Why This Matters:**
Names create identity. Identity creates consistency. The council is no longer "The Commander" or "DealFlowStrategist" — they are Atlas, Hawk, Shield. They speak with authority, not as generic roles.

First digest with new names delivers tomorrow (Sunday 6 PM).
