# Memory Log - February 19, 2026

## Key Events & Decisions
1. **Model Migration:**
   - Successfully switched from Claude Sonnet 4.5 to GPT-4o as the primary model.
   - GPT-4o-mini remains as muscle for high-volume tasks.
   - Anthropic API key kept as an inactive backup.

2. **Dormant Agent Purge:**
   - Strategy: Purge from SmartContact agents who have received 10 or more messages in the last 90 days with zero replies.
   - Data: 6,200 agents split between DPV (5,200) and Doxa Property Ventures (900).
   - DPV identified as the main nurture engine. Actions to be monitored and improved here.
   - Doxa testing friendlier approaches via a bot.

3. **GHL Analysis:**
   - Jonathan directed to run GHL agent analysis based on similar criteria to SC, focusing on 'ASAP' for efficiency.
   - Confirmed that the bot is actively engaged in Doxa with a different operational approach.

4. **Current Operations:**
   - No background activity or scheduling until further notice due to Anthropic concerns.
   - General monitoring and readiness for future tasks when prompted.
