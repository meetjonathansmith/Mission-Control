## KEY INSIGHTS FOR JONATHAN'S BRAND

### What Works (From Proven Frameworks):

1. **B-Roll reels perform** - 3-5 second clips, movement, match message
2. **Numbered lists convert** - "These 4 things..." / "The only 10..."
3. **Timeline transformations resonate** - "730 days ago..." / "After making $2M..."
4. **Authority + vulnerability** - "I'm done gatekeeping" + "Here's what I wish I knew"
5. **Contrarian takes** - "Stop doing X" / "Things that'll get me cancelled"
6. **POV/Scenario hooks** - "POV: You're no longer anxious because..."
7. **Identity shift content** - Help audience see themselves in new role
8. **Comment triggers for DMs** - Single keyword drives ManyChat automation
9. **Carousels for depth** - Multi-slide storytelling with CTAs
10. **Fast-paced audio** - Beat-matched transitions keep attention

### What to AVOID:

1. War language (fight, grind, hustle, war, attack) - per V2 directive
2. Generic motivation - Must be tied to Jonathan's real story
3. Dark/blurry videos - Breaks engagement
4. B-roll that doesn't match message - Confuses viewer
5. Too many options - Decision paralysis kills conversions

### Perfect Fit for Jonathan:

**Agent Freedom content should use:**
- Template 6 (Timeline): "$80M agent → 17 rentals" story
- Template 7 (Post-success): "After building 17 rentals, here's what I wish agents knew..."
- Template 13 (Contrarian): "Things that'll get me cancelled by the REI community"
- Carousel 6 (Timeline): Listing agent → rental owner → eXp downline builder

**Kingdom + Business content should use:**
- Template 2 (Hard lessons): "It took me burning out to understand these 4 Kingdom business principles..."
- Template 8 (POV): "POV: You're no longer anxious about money because you learned Kingdom stewardship"
- Vulnerable prompts: "What you don't see on Instagram is me praying through deal decisions"

**DTA Machine content should use:**
- Template 1 (Transformation): "When LM reviews 107 off-markets and we ratify 4... But all I did was build a 20-minute review system"
- Template 3 (Stop doing): "Stop trying to chase on-market deals - here's how off-market works"
- Template 15 (24-hour challenge): "If I had to generate 10 off-markets in 24 hours..."
