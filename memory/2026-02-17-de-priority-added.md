# Delaware (DE) Priority Zone Added — February 17, 2026 (11:56 AM)

## What Changed

Added Delaware (DE) as SECOND priority zone in Response Priority Framework.

## Key Details

**DE Structure:**
- DE agents are inside MD list (not separate campaign)
- ✅ ALL DEAL TYPES ALLOWED (no crew constraint like DC)
- Second priority (after DC, before standard MD)

**New Priority Order:**
1. **DC-area deals** (from MD or NOVA lists) → wholesale/dispo ONLY (crew constraint)
2. **Delaware deals** (from MD list) → ✅ ALL DEAL TYPES (fix-and-flip, BRRR, wholesale, assignment)
3. **MD deals** (non-DC, non-DE) → all deal types
4. **Richmond deals** → all deal types
5. **NOVA deals** (non-DC) → all deal types
6. **VA Beach deals** → paused

**Geographic Scope of Delaware:**
- All three counties: New Castle, Kent, Sussex
- Cities: Wilmington, Dover, Newark, Middletown, Smyrna, Lewes, Rehoboth Beach

**Why DE Gets Priority:**
- Close to MD/NOVA operations (strategic expansion market)
- NO crew constraint (unlike DC) — can execute all deal types
- May have FASTER velocity than MD (smaller market, less competition)

**Why No Crew Constraint in DE:**
- Different regulatory environment than DC
- Crew availability stable in DE market
- No ICE-related disruptions impacting construction labor

## What Was Updated in SC Operations Manual

### 1. Response Priority Table (Line 562)
Added DE as Priority #2 with GHL tags:
- "DE-Acquisition" or "DE-Wholesale"
- ✅ ALL DEAL TYPES ALLOWED

### 2. DE Operational Section (New)
Added comprehensive DE section after DC section including:
- Why Delaware gets priority
- Tom's instructions for DE deals
- Geographic scope
- No crew constraint explanation
- Impact on volume targets

### 3. Example Scenarios (6 total now)
Added Scenario 3: Wilmington, DE property example
- Shows full acquisition analysis workflow
- GHL tagging: "DE-Acquisition" or "DE-Wholesale"
- Priority #2 handling

### 4. Tom's Daily Workflow
Updated morning checklist:
- Check MD list → Flag DC-area AND Delaware properties
- Priority order now includes DE as second

Updated escalation rules:
- DE acquisition deals: Tom underwrites, Jonathan approves if >$50K OR complex zoning
- Same escalation as MD/Richmond/NOVA (not like DC wholesale)

### 5. Executive Summary
Updated execution strategy to mention:
- "DC-area deals FIRST (wholesale-only), Delaware deals SECOND (all deal types), then MD, Richmond, NOVA"
- "DC and DE are NOT separate campaigns — they are geographic priority zones within MD/NOVA lists"

### 6. STEP 1: Identify Geographic Location
Updated MD list check:
- "MD list agent → Check: Is property in DC area? Is property in Delaware? If neither, standard MD."

### 7. Critical Distinction Note
Updated to clarify:
- "When deals come in from MD list, Tom checks: 'Is this DC-area? Is this Delaware?' Priority: DC first (wholesale-only), DE second (all deal types), then standard MD."
- "NOVA list: Check for DC-area only (no DE agents in NOVA)."

### 8. Implementation Roadmap (Week 1)
Updated training requirement:
- OLD: "Train Tom on DC-area deal priority (wholesale/dispo ONLY)"
- NEW: "Train Tom on priority framework: DC-area FIRST (wholesale-only), Delaware SECOND (all deal types), then MD, Richmond, NOVA"

Updated GHL tagging:
- OLD: "All DC-area deals tagged as 'DC-Wholesale'"
- NEW: "DC-area deals tagged as 'DC-Wholesale', Delaware deals tagged as 'DE-Acquisition' or 'DE-Wholesale'"

### 9. What to Do Monday Morning
Updated step 6:
- "Train Tom on Response Priority Framework: DC-area deals FIRST (wholesale-only), Delaware deals SECOND (all deal types), then MD, Richmond, NOVA"

Updated step 7:
- "Tag priority zone deals in GHL: DC-area as 'DC-Wholesale' (wholesale-only), Delaware as 'DE-Acquisition' or 'DE-Wholesale' (all deal types)"

## Tom's Workflow Impact

**When MD list agent responds:**
1. Check: Is this DC-area? → Yes = Priority #1, tag "DC-Wholesale", wholesale-only underwriting
2. Check: Is this Delaware? → Yes = Priority #2, tag "DE-Acquisition" or "DE-Wholesale", full acquisition analysis
3. If neither → Priority #3 (standard MD), tag "MD-Acquisition" or "MD-Wholesale"

**When NOVA list agent responds:**
1. Check: Is this DC-area? → Yes = Priority #1, tag "DC-Wholesale", wholesale-only underwriting
2. If no → Priority #5 (standard NOVA), tag "NOVA-Acquisition" or "NOVA-Wholesale"

**Priority Order for Daily Underwriting:**
1. DC-area deals (wholesale-only)
2. Delaware deals (all deal types)
3. MD deals (non-DC, non-DE)
4. Richmond deals
5. NOVA deals (non-DC)

## Strategic Implications

**For Volume Targets:**
- DE deals count toward ratification goals (same as MD)
- DE may close FASTER than MD (less competition, smaller market)
- No additional campaigns needed (DE agents already in MD list)

**For Crew Management:**
- DE has NO crew constraint (unlike DC)
- Can execute fix-and-flip, BRRR, wholesale, assignment in DE
- Crew availability stable in DE market

**For Deal Pipeline:**
- DC + DE combined = highest priority deals from MD list
- If DC produces wholesale deals + DE produces acquisition deals = diversified pipeline
- DE second priority ensures faster response to Delaware opportunities

## Manual Status

**UPDATED and ready.**

All sections now reflect:
- DE as second priority zone (after DC, before MD)
- No crew constraint for DE deals (all deal types allowed)
- Tom's workflow includes DE geographic check
- GHL tagging includes "DE-Acquisition" and "DE-Wholesale" tags
- Example scenarios include Delaware property
- Training requirements updated for Tom

**Ready to deploy with DE priority framework.**
