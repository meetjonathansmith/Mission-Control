# Newsletter Protocol - The Smith Letter

**Updated:** 2026-02-12 07:03 EST

## Mandatory Structure

Every story MUST follow this exact format:

### [Story Headline]

[Story description/facts - 2-4 paragraphs with data, quotes, context]

Why it matters:

[Strategic analysis for operators - no line break, flows directly from "Why it matters:"]

Source: [URL]

---

## Overall Framework

1. **Opening** - Personal insight, lesson, or market observation (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **What's Moving the Market** - 3 stories (major shifts, policy changes, data releases)
3. **What's Worth Watching** - 3 stories (emerging trends, future implications, opportunities)
4. **Jon's Take** - Strategic synthesis (2-4 paragraphs)
5. **CTAs** - 3 standard CTAs + sign-off

## Story Format Rules

- **Headline:** Clear, specific, data-driven when possible
- **Description:** 4-6 sentences max. Facts first, context second. Include numbers, quotes, key data.
- **"Why it matters:"** Always on its own line, followed by 2-3 sentences max of operator-focused analysis
- **No bolding** the "Why it matters:" text
- **Source:** Always include working URL

## Length Requirements (CRITICAL)

- **Story body:** 4-6 sentences maximum
- **Why it matters:** 2-3 sentences maximum
- Keep it tight. This is a scan-read newsletter for busy operators, not long-form journalism.

## Tone & Style

- Direct, confident, no fluff
- Data-driven but not academic
- Operator perspective (what does this mean for deal flow, capital deployment, risk?)
- Short sentences when impact matters
- No hedging language

## Sources to Monitor

Primary:
- jonathanksmith.substack.com (archive for past examples)
- Kathy Fettke's Real Estate News for Investors
- One Rental at a Time (YouTube)
- HousingWire
- Inman
- ATTOM Data
- RealPage reports
- Census Bureau (construction data)
- NPR/AP (policy/macro)

## Examples of Good "Why it matters:" Sections

✅ "This is a generational wealth concentration issue disguised as housing policy. For operators: the disconnect between senior wealth accumulation and their ability to extract maximum value on exit creates opportunity."

✅ "Foreclosure pipelines are filling, but inventory isn't flooding the market yet. That lag creates opportunity for operators who can move fast on pre-foreclosure deals before institutional buyers scale up."

✅ "National headlines don't tell the whole story. Local fundamentals matter more than macro narratives. Watch for supply/demand imbalances in secondary metros."

❌ "This could be good or bad depending on how things develop."
❌ "Experts say this is concerning."
❌ "We'll have to wait and see."

## Rotating Funny CTA (Every Other Newsletter)

**Frequency:** Include in every other newsletter (alternating weeks)

**Format:**
- Engaging headline (playful, relatable frustration)
- GIF that matches the vibe (office humor, pop culture, relatable moment)
- 3-4 sentences of copy
- CTA: Text 443.569.7858 with deal details

**Purpose:** Generate off-market deal flow from agents with problem listings

**Library of options:** See `memory/newsletter-cta-library.md` for rotating options

**Placement:** Between last "What's Worth Watching" story and "Jon's Take"
