# DOXA Business Story (Oct 2025 - Feb 2026)
## Jonathan's Journey & Current State

### The Business Model

**What DOXA does:**
- Text real estate agents (via Smarter Contact platform)
- Agents respond with off-market properties (distressed, motivated sellers)
- DOXA makes offers on those properties (wholesale/assignment model)
- Ratified deals → Closed deals → Revenue

**Target model (documented Nov 2025):**
- 10,000 texts → 25 off-market properties → 6 offers → 1 ratified deal → 1 closed deal
- 125,000-135,000 texts/month needed for 10 closed deals/month
- Primary constraint: Offer-to-ratified conversion (target 20%)

## 5-Month Performance Timeline

### October 2025 (Month 1)
- **Texts:** 48,522
- **Conversations:** 881 (1.82% response rate) ⭐ HIGHEST
- **Off-market:** 108
- **Offers:** 114
- **Ratified:** 8
- **Closed:** 0

**Key metrics:**
- Texts per off-market: 449/1
- Off-market to offers: 106% (more offers than off-market properties??)
- Offers to ratified: 7%

**Notes:** Best response rate of all 5 months. Very aggressive on offers (sent more than properties received). Low ratification rate.

---

### November 2025 (Month 2)
- **Texts:** 95,537 (+97% vs Oct)
- **Conversations:** 732 (0.77% response rate) ⬇️
- **Off-market:** 124
- **Offers:** 105
- **Ratified:** 5
- **Closed:** 0

**Key metrics:**
- Texts per off-market: 770/1
- Off-market to offers: 85%
- Offers to ratified: 4.8%

**Notes:** Doubled volume, but response rate crashed. Ratification rate also dropped. First month with documented target model in sheet footer.

---

### December 2025 (Month 3)
- **Texts:** 108,509 (+14% vs Nov)
- **Conversations:** 1,142 (1.05% response rate) ⬆️
- **Off-market:** 141
- **Offers:** 43
- **Ratified:** 6
- **Closed:** 0

**Key metrics:**
- Texts per off-market: 769/1
- Off-market to offers: 30%
- Offers to ratified: 14%

**Notes:** Response rate recovered slightly. Dramatically reduced offers (43 vs 105 in Nov) but ratification rate improved to 14%. More selective on which properties to offer on.

---

### January 2026 (Month 4)
- **Texts:** 53,481 (-51% vs Dec)
- **Conversations:** 812 (1.52% response rate) ⭐ BEST EFFICIENCY
- **Off-market:** 137
- **Offers:** 30
- **Ratified:** 4
- **Closed:** 0

**Key metrics:**
- Texts per off-market: 390/1 (ON TARGET)
- Off-market to offers: 22%
- Offers to ratified: 13%

**Notes:** Cut volume in half. Response rate jumped to highest since Oct. Hit target ratio for texts-per-off-market. Continued selectivity on offers.

---

### February 2026 (Month 5, through Feb 13)
- **Texts:** 47,868 (projected ~110k full month)
- **Conversations:** 445 (0.93% response rate) ⬇️
- **Off-market:** 107
- **Offers:** 33
- **Ratified:** 2
- **Closed:** 1 ⭐ FIRST CLOSE

**Key metrics:**
- Texts per off-market: 448/1
- Off-market to offers: 31%
- Offers to ratified: 6%

**Notes:** Volume ramped back up, response rate declined again. But FIRST CLOSED DEAL (Kayak or Gunther, one of the two ratified in week 1). Ratification rate dropped to lowest yet.

---

## The Pattern: Volume vs Efficiency Tradeoff

### High Volume Months (Nov, Dec, Feb)
- 95k-110k texts/month
- 0.77%-1.05% response rate
- Less efficient (more cost per conversation)

### Low Volume Month (Jan)
- 53k texts
- 1.52% response rate
- Most efficient (fewer texts per off-market property)

### Peak Response Month (Oct)
- 48k texts
- 1.82% response rate
- But very low ratification (7%, too aggressive on offers)

**Conclusion:** There's a volume ceiling around 60k texts/month. Above that, list fatigue and saturation kill response rates.

---

## The Critical Constraint: Offer-to-Ratified

**5-Month performance:**
- Oct: 7.0% (8/114)
- Nov: 4.8% (5/105)
- Dec: 14.0% (6/43)
- Jan: 13.3% (4/30)
- Feb: 6.1% (2/33)

**Average: 9.2%**  
**Target: 20%**  
**Gap: You're 54% below target**

**What changed in Dec/Jan?**
- Dramatically reduced offer volume (43-30 vs 105-114)
- Ratification rate improved (14% vs 5-7%)
- **Hypothesis:** Quality over quantity. Being more selective = higher ratification.

**What happened in Feb?**
- Ratification crashed back to 6%
- Volume similar to Jan (33 offers)
- **Hypothesis:** Early month data? Or reverting to old patterns?

---

## The Ratified-to-Closed Mystery

**Total ratified deals (5 months):** 25  
- Oct: 8
- Nov: 5
- Dec: 6
- Jan: 4
- Feb: 2

**Total closed deals:** 1 (Feb week 1)

**Where are the other 24 deals?**

**Possibilities:**
1. **Timing lag:** Typical timeline is 30-60 days from ratified to close
   - If true, Oct-Dec deals (19 total) should be closing now/soon
   - Jan deals (4) should close in March
   - Feb deals (2) should close in April

2. **Fall-through rate:** Some ratified deals never close
   - "Deals that didn't sell" tracked: 8 across 5 months
   - But only 8 documented vs 24 missing deals
   - Either more fell through (not documented), or timing lag explains most

3. **Mixed:** Some timing lag + some fall-through

**Critical question for Jonathan:** Where are Oct-Dec ratified deals? Closed but not logged? Fell through? Still pending?

## Response Rate Degradation Analysis

**5-Month trend:**
- Oct: 1.82%
- Nov: 0.77% (-58%)
- Dec: 1.05% (+36%)
- Jan: 1.52% (+45%)
- Feb: 0.93% (-39%)

**Weekly peaks:**
- Oct Week 3: 1.51%
- Nov Week 3: 0.84%
- Dec Week 3: 1.18%
- Jan Week 2: 2.38% ⭐ ALL-TIME HIGH
- Feb Week 2: 1.27%

**Pattern:** Response rate is volatile and volume-dependent. High volume = low response. Low volume = high response.

**But there's more:** Even at similar volume (Nov at 95k vs Dec at 108k), response varied (0.77% vs 1.05%). Message content, list freshness, or timing also matter.

## SC Campaign Deep Dive (From Exports)

**3 Campaigns analyzed (Feb data):**
- Feb 1st: 23,254 leads → 950 responded (4.09%)
- Feb 1st B: 17,603 leads → 671 responded (3.81%)
- VA Beach: 7,330 leads → 680 responded (9.28%) ⭐

**Delivery rates (all excellent):**
- Feb 1st: 96.7% delivered
- Feb 1st B: 97.6% delivered
- VA Beach: 95.9% delivered

**Key finding:** VA Beach campaign gets 2.4x better response than others. If VA Beach model could be replicated, deal flow would 2-3x.

**Critical unknowns:**
- What message is being sent in VA Beach vs others?
- Why is VA Beach so much better?
- Is it geography (smaller market, less saturated)?
- Or targeting (agent type, list quality)?
- Or message content?

---

## The Current State (Feb 13, 2026)

**Where Jonathan is now:**
- Running ~110k texts/month (approaching target volume)
- Getting 0.93% response rate (below recent history)
- Generating ~100 off-market properties/month
- Sending ~30 offers/month
- Ratifying ~2 deals/month (way below target)
- Closed 1 deal in 5 months

**Revenue:**
- 1 closed deal = $78k assignment fee (Jonathan's actual deal, not the $32k in example templates)
- Annualized at current pace: ~2.4 closed deals/year = ~$187k/year
- Target: 10 deals/month = 120 deals/year = ~$9.4M/year (at $78k avg)

**The gap:**
- Current: 0.2 deals/month
- Target: 10 deals/month
- **Need to 50x deal flow**

---

## What's Working

✅ **Bottom-funnel efficiency improving**
- Conversations → Off-market: 12% (Oct) → 24% (Feb), +100%
- Agents who respond are sending better quality properties

✅ **Offer selectivity improving**
- Reduced offers from 105-114/month (Oct-Nov) to 30-43/month (Dec-Feb)
- Ratification improved from 5-7% to 13-14% (Dec-Jan)

✅ **VA Beach campaign model**
- 9.28% response vs 0.93% overall
- Proof that 10x better performance is possible with right targeting/message

✅ **First closed deal**
- Broke the seal in Feb 2026
- Proves the model works end-to-end

---

## What's Broken

⚠️ **Response rate declining**
- Down 39% from Jan to Feb
- High volume kills efficiency
- Need message refresh, list rotation, or targeting improvement

⚠️ **Offer-to-ratified conversion**
- 9.2% actual vs 20% target
- This is THE constraint
- 90% of offers are rejected
- Need to understand why: price? terms? speed? relationship?

⚠️ **Ratified-to-closed tracking gap**
- 25 ratified deals, only 1 closed
- Either massive fall-through problem or timing lag
- No clear tracking system for deal pipeline

⚠️ **Volume ceiling**
- Can't scale past ~60k texts/month without efficiency collapse
- Need to fix response rate before scaling further

## The 78k Story (What Jonathan Wants to Share)

**What Jonathan said (Feb 13, 2026):**
> "I made $78,000 on a wholesale deal. However, I don't know that I feel comfortable posting about making 78K — it's your classic investor post that seems to be a pissing contest."

**Jonathan's content mandate:**
- Document what he's DONE, not what others should do
- Lead with mistakes and learning, not results
- Transparency over flexing
- Journey documentation, not guru positioning
- No money pissing contests

**The real story Jonathan should tell:**
- 5 months of grinding (Oct-Feb)
- 25 ratified deals, 24 fell through or are pending
- First closed deal in month 5
- Made $78k, but it took 305,000+ texts to get there
- Cost per closed deal (so far): Massive
- Learning: Volume ≠ success, conversion rates matter more
- The grind is real, most deals don't close, and that's okay

**That's an authentic story.** Not "here's how I made $78k" but "here's what it took to close my first wholesale deal after 5 months of texting 60,000 agents."

## Strategic Recommendations (Informed by Full History)

### Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Ratified deal tracking**
   - Create pipeline sheet: Ratified date → Expected close → Actual close → Reason if fell through
   - Track Oct-Dec deals: Where are they?
   - Establish baseline close timeline

2. **Response rate diagnostic**
   - Pull SC message logs for Feb 1st vs VA Beach campaigns
   - Identify exact difference in messaging/targeting
   - Test VA Beach message in 2-3 new markets

3. **Offer post-mortem**
   - Pull last 50 non-ratified offers
   - Categorize failures: Price too low? Terms? Speed? Relationship?
   - Identify top 3 failure modes

### Next 30 Days

4. **Message refresh campaign**
   - Write 3-5 new message variations
   - A/B test against current messages
   - Goal: 1.5%+ response rate

5. **Volume optimization**
   - Cut bottom 25% of campaigns by response rate
   - Redirect budget to high-performers (VA Beach model)
   - Target 60-80k texts/month at 1.5%+ response (not 110k at 0.93%)

6. **Offer process tightening**
   - Only offer on properties that match buyer criteria
   - Speed up offer response (within 4 hours of receiving property)
   - Pre-qualify agents before sending offers (relationship > cold offers)

### Next 90 Days

7. **Scale what works**
   - If VA Beach message tests work: Scale to all campaigns
   - If offer process improvements work: Ratification should hit 15-20%
   - Then and only then: Scale volume to 125-135k/month

8. **Build back-end systems**
   - Close rate optimization (if fall-through is the issue)
   - Buyer bench expansion (more buyers = higher ratification odds)
   - LM/VA training on conversion tactics

**Target: 10 deals/month by June 2026** (achievable if constraints are fixed)

---

## Bottom Line: Jonathan's Real Position

**Jonathan is not failing. He's in the messy middle of building.**

- 5 months in
- 1 closed deal ($78k)
- 24 ratified deals in various states (likely some will close soon)
- Proven model (response → off-market → offers → ratifications → close)
- Found a winning campaign (VA Beach at 9.28%)
- Learned that volume ≠ success (Jan was most efficient at 53k texts)

**The path forward is clear:**
1. Fix offer-to-ratified (biggest leverage point)
2. Replicate VA Beach model (10x response potential)
3. Track ratified-to-closed pipeline (know where deals actually are)
4. Scale intelligently (quality over quantity)

**This is a content gold mine if told authentically:**
- "5 months, 305,000 texts, 25 ratifications, 1 close. Here's what I learned."
- "Why I cut my text volume in half and doubled my efficiency."
- "The $78k deal that almost didn't happen (and the 24 that are still pending)."
- "I sent 211 offers in 5 months. Only 25 got accepted. Here's why."

**That's the story. Not "how to make $78k" but "what it actually takes to build a wholesale business from scratch."**
