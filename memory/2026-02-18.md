# Memory Log - February 18, 2026

## Mission Control Navigation Build (Afternoon/Evening)

### Work Session Started
- **Task**: Build all 8 navigation sections in priority order
- **Backup created**: `mission-control-backup-feb18.html` before modifications
- **Current progress**: Reading HTML structure at line 1640, identifying placeholder sections
- **Priority order**: Approvals → Tasks → Council → Calendar → Projects → Memory → Docs → People

### Operating Rules Reinforced
1. **Sequential execution**: One task at a time with confirmation before moving to next
2. **Approval before building**: Present findings, get approval, then build
3. **Background scanning limited**: 15 minutes at END of task list only, single message for approval
4. **Code generation stays on BRAIN**: "Broken code costs more than tokens" - Jonathan's directive

### Technical Details
- **Previous CSS fix**: Missing closing brace in line 917 caused navigation styles to break
- **Fix committed**: GitHub commit 55291f4 pushed successfully
- **API spend**: $172/$300 (57% of budget)
- **API limit increased**: From $200 to $300 monthly

## Smith Letter Work

### Reformatting Complete
- All 6 stories reformatted to Jonathan's exact spec
- Format: Headline (8 words), TL;DR (one sentence), Context (3-5 sentences), Why it matters (2-3 sentences), 120-150 words per story
- Jon's Take drafted (3 paragraphs)
- Opening paragraph added
- All source URLs verified
- **Status**: Awaiting Jonathan's CTAs to publish

## Financial Updates

### Profit First Allocation Calculated
- **Deal amount**: $27,500
- **Breakdown**:
  - Profit (15%): $4,125
  - Owner's Pay (60%): $16,500
  - Tax (10%): $2,750
  - OpEx (15%): $4,125

### Mission Control Updated
- Projected revenue: $114K
- CC Actual: $30,650
- CC Projected: $64,600
- All numbers verified from KPI sheet

## Health & Training

### Creatine Day 2 (Feb 18)
- Felt significantly stronger during workout
- **Analysis**: Too early for real ATP boost (phosphocreatine stores take 5-7 days to saturate)
- Likely factors: Recovery from Day 1 + placebo effect + water retention
- Protocol continues: 20g/day loading through Week 2

### Chest/Shoulders Workout
- 16 sets total
- Incline press: 5×12 @145 lbs
- Shoulder press: 6×15 @100 lbs
- Flys: 5×15 @90 lbs + 1×40 @70 lbs

### Constipation Issue Addressed
- **Root cause**: Low fiber (not dehydration despite 160-192oz water/day)
- **Solution**:
  - 25-30g fiber/day (oats, berries, veggies, beans)
  - Magnesium citrate 400-600mg before bed
  - Coffee in morning
  - 10-minute walk after breakfast
- Creatine does NOT cause constipation directly

## Content Work

### Scripts Delivered
1. **"Why Men Stay Stuck"** - Observation hook version ready to film
2. **Shame reel script** - Full 60-75 second script complete

### YouTube Research
- Postponed until after navigation sections complete
- 4 creators to study: Kyle Mechlinski, Goshen Official, Myron Golden, Rabbi Daniel Lapin

## System Updates

### Cron Jobs
- All updated with 9-advisor names (Feb 18)
- Weekend jobs disabled (Mon-Fri only)
- Board Meeting + Week Ahead provide weekend coverage

### Google Sheets Access
- **Doxa Financials 2026** accessed via browser relay
- "Operators Paid" column split into "LM Paid" and "VA Paid" (Jonathan completed manually)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Navigation sections prioritization**: Main (done) → Approvals (next) → Rest of sections
2. **Don't ship empty pages**: Build all sections before pushing
3. **YouTube research can wait**: Priority shifted to completing navigation work today
4. **Smith Letter structure locked**: Exact format requirements documented and applied
5. **API limit increase approved**: $200 → $300 monthly budget

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. **Complete all 8 navigation sections** - Approvals through People
2. **Daily brief enhancement** - Add "Tasks I Can Take Off Your Plate Today" section starting Feb 19
3. **Week 1 SC implementation continues** - Attribution deployment, train VA

## Files Updated Today
- Mission Control HTML (multiple times, commit 55291f4)
- Smith Letter reformatted and saved to Desktop
- Smith Letter source links document created
- Mission Control backup created

## Context Preserved

### Navigation Section Content Plan
- **Approvals**: Content approval queue where Quill stages content with caption/hashtags/suggested time, Jonathan reviews in batch
- **Tasks**: Expanded task pipeline view
- **Council**: 9 advisors with roles, digests, status
- **Calendar**: Content calendar view
- **Projects**: Active projects tracker
- **Memory**: Memory file index
- **Docs**: Document links
- **People**: Contacts/team
