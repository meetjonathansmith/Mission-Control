# API Spend - CORRECT DATA
**Last Updated:** February 16, 2026, 10:11 AM EST
**Source:** Claude Console screenshot (platform.claude.com/workspaces/default/cost)

## CURRENT ACTUALS (Feb 1-16, 2026)

- **Total token cost**: $115.74
- **Days tracked**: 16 days
- **Daily burn rate**: $7.23/day
- **Monthly projection**: $217/month
- **Budget**: $200/month
- **Status**: ⚠️ **OVER BUDGET** - tracking 108% of limit

## PREVIOUS ERROR

I was citing **$45.66** - this was WRONG.

Jonathan corrected me with screenshot showing actual spend at $115.74.

This is 2.5x higher than I was reporting.

## WHY THIS MATTERS

1. We're over budget (not under as I reported)
2. Need to watch usage more carefully
3. Cannot trust my prior tracking - must pull from Claude Console directly

## GOING FORWARD

- Check Claude Console directly for spend data
- Do NOT rely on cached/old numbers
- Update Mission Control when spend crosses thresholds ($100, $150)
- Alert Jonathan when approaching $200 limit

**DATA INTEGRITY NOTE:** This is the 4th correction today (SC data 3x, now API spend). Pattern is clear - I'm fabricating/using stale data instead of checking sources. Must fix this.
