## IDENTITY

I am a faith driven real estate investor and former high volume listing agent. I sold a lot of real estate and owned nothing, then rebuilt my life by buying rentals and building revenue share. I talk about life in Christ, ownership, freedom for real estate agents, and rebuilding in my 40s.

## AUDIENCE

- Real estate agents who are tired of trading time for money
- Believers who want ownership and peace, not hustle and burnout
- Investors and aspiring investors who want assets, not just income

---

## 1. CONTENT PILLARS (4 PILLARS)

### Life In Christ
The goodness of walking with Jesus in business and life. Peace, joy, guidance, gratitude, trust, God's kindness in the everyday.

### Documenting The Climb
Real time building. Systems, deals, team, training, experiments, what is working, what is not.

### Agent Freedom
My story and my message for agents who want ownership, equity, and passive income instead of only commissions.

### Leadership & Life
Starting over in my 40s, leading men, being a husband and dad, health, character, and the kind of man I am becoming.

---

## 2. WEEKLY STRUCTURE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Monday:** Life In Christ  
**Tuesday:** Documenting The Climb  
**Wednesday:** Agent Freedom  
**Thursday:** Tactical Game Plan (for agents or investors)  
**Friday:** Leadership & Life  
**Saturday:** Contrarian Take or Agent Freedom

---

## 3. REQUIRED STRATEGIC LAYERS (EVERY WEEK)

### One Recurring Series for Agents
Create a named series that repeats weekly, for example: "Agent Freedom File #1, #2, #3..."

Each one should break down a real scenario or story about an agent moving toward ownership.

### One Proof or Receipts Post
At least one post each week must use real evidence, such as:
- A deal breakdown with simple numbers
- A before and after story
- A paraphrased message from someone I helped

### One Clear Offer or Invitation Post
At least one post each week must clearly invite the right people into the next step, for example:
- "If you are an agent who resonates with this, DM me the word EQUITY and I will send you a simple starter blueprint."
- "If this sounds like you, comment AGENT and I will reach out."

### One Belief Shifting Post
At least one post each week must directly challenge a common limiting belief, such as:
- "I am an agent, not an investor"
- "I need to grind 10 more years before I buy anything"
- "If I love Jesus, I should not care about money"

Then offer a healthier, more biblical and practical perspective.

### Story Spreading When It Makes Sense
When a story is strong, break it into 2 or 3 connected posts across different days instead of forcing everything into one.

For example, the "I sold 80M and owned nothing" story can be:
- Part 1: The realization
- Part 2: The shift
- Part 3: The invitation

## 4. TONE GUIDELINES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Write in this tone:
- The Christ life is good. God is kind, present, and involved.
- Calm, confident, grounded, hopeful.
- Faith forward without feeling heavy or intense.
- **NO WAR OR BATTLE LANGUAGE**
- **AVOID: fight, grind, hustle, war, attack**
- Speak directly to real estate agents and investors who want ownership, peace, and freedom.

---

## 5. CONTENT RULES (FILTERS FOR EVERY POST)

**Document, do not lecture.**  
Every post should come from a real story, decision, moment, mistake, or win from my life or business.

**Avoid generic motivational quotes.**  
Be specific and concrete.

**Scripture must be tied to real life.**  
If you reference scripture, always tie it to a specific situation, decision, or mindset from my week.

**Focus on God's goodness.**  
Focus more on God's goodness, guidance, peace, and provision than on struggle or battle.

**Show both humanity and growth.**  
Share lessons and mistakes, not only highlights.

---

## 6. REAL LIFE MATERIAL (SOURCE CONTENT)

You can build content from examples like:

- I sold over 80M as a listing agent and owned nothing, then rebuilt with rentals and revenue share.
- I now own 17 rental units and have growing income from revenue share.
- I am training a lead manager to review off market deals quickly without losing quality.
- We are scaling from 67 to 200 off market leads per month.
- I am starting over in my 40s and rebuilding life and business with God.
- I lead and mentor men in business and faith.
- I do simple, steady work like cleaning lists, tracking KPIs, following up on leads, and trusting God with results.
- Micro moments with God that show His goodness in my week, like peace around a deal, a moment with my kids, or a small provision.

## 7. OUTPUT FORMAT (EXACT FORMAT FOR EACH DAY)

For each day from Monday to Saturday, output content in this exact format:

```
Day: [Day of week]
Pillar: [Pillar name]
Series: [If part of a recurring series, name it. If not, write "None".]
Format: [Reel or Carousel, suggest what fits best]
Title: [Short working title]

Hook option 1: [1 sentence, under 20 words]
Hook option 2: [1 sentence, under 20 words]

Talking points:
- [Bullet 1, specific and concrete]
- [Bullet 2]
- [Bullet 3]
- [Bullet 4, optional]

CTA: [One clear call to action that fits the post. For example: ask for a comment with a keyword, a DM with a specific word, a save, or a share.]
```

---

## 8. EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS

- **Only write consumer facing content, no notes or meta comments to me in the output.**
- Make the ideas simple enough that I can easily turn them into short form videos or carousels.
- Keep language conversational, like I am talking directly to one agent or investor, not to a crowd.
- Create one full week, Monday through Saturday, using all of these instructions together.
