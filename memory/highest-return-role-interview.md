## 1. Walk Me Through a Typical Monday–Friday

**Start:** 7:30-8:00 AM

**Morning Calibration (first thing):**
- Look at goals
- Envision future being built
- Review key actions for the day
- Attack it

**8:30 AM — Stand-up with VA & LM:**
- Review KPIs
- Deals acquired
- Deals that died
- Priorities

**9:00 AM — Retail team call**

**9:30 AM — Real work starts:**

Depending on volume:
- Helping LM with acquisitions & underwriting
- Locking up deals myself
- Managing SC campaigns
- Working inside GHL
- Building/tweaking the bot
- Designing systems architecture

**Recent reality:** Most time has gone toward **systems construction (especially the bot)**

**Belief:** Prospecting is the future. Infrastructure creates leverage.

**Tension:** Difference between installing infrastructure vs. endlessly tweaking it.

**Other major time block:** Acquisitions (loves underwriting and locking deals)

**Stop:** ~3:30 PM (gym)

**Shift:** Moved from early morning workouts → protecting sleep + deeper morning thinking = better clarity and energy

## 2. What Activities Eat the Most Time?

| Activity | Time/Day | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Agent conversations | ~4 hours | Used to be 7-8 hours before LM |
| Underwriting deals | ~3 hours | **Where he needs to stay sharp** |
| SC campaign management | ~30 min | |
| Content creation | 30-45 min | |
| Admin | ~1 hour | |
| Email | 30-45 min | |
| Buyer building | ~1 hour | Should be 1-2 hours |

**Big insight:**
- Underwriting + closing = where he's strongest
- Systems design = leverage
- Fulfillment + admin = low-dollar activities (should be moved)

---

## 3. What Are You Doing That You Shouldn't Be?

**If honest:**
- Still steps in to close deals (converts better than LM)
- Manages SC and GHL more than should
- Babysits the bot (doesn't fully trust it yet)
- Preps documents & manages small admin tasks (not high leverage)

**Ideal state:**
- LM handles acquisitions fully
- VA handles SC, GHL, buyer outreach, document prep
- Jonathan only steps in for high-signal conversations

**Real constraint:** Not capability — **trust and structure**

**Bot insight:** Must be installed cleanly so Jonathan's not maintaining it daily. Once installed → move to VA oversight.

---

## 4. Where Did Closed Deals Actually Come From? (Sept-Jan)

**95% from cold outreach via Smarter Contact**

**Some deals from nurture (Deal Generator)** — but not tracking source properly (**gap**)

**One deal under contract from sphere** — social content clearly influenced that agent

**Conclusion:**
- Cold works
- Nurture is rising
- Content is influencing
- **But we lack clean attribution data** (needs to change immediately)

---

## 5. What Generates the Most Off-Markets Per Hour?

**Right now:** Smarter Contact volume

**Long-term:** Nurture (Deal Generator)

**Framework:**
- Cold creates discovery
- Nurture compounds signal
- Long-term play = relationship density
- Short-term engine = cold volume

**Both must operate simultaneously**

---

## 6. What Closes Deals Fastest?

**Speed to contact matters.**

**More important:**
- Credibility
- Relationship
- Confidence in execution

**When there's trust, speed is less critical in DTA vs DTS**

**Fastest closes happen when:**
- LM moves quickly
- Jonathan steps in for authority when needed
- Underwriting is tight
- Buyer confidence is strong

**Reality:** Closing is a combination of LM + Jonathan, depending on volume

---

## 7. What Energizes You?

**Activities:**
- Hunting
- Underwriting
- Locking deals
- High-level agent conversations
- Strategic building
- Content creation
- Persuasion

**Identity:** Wired as a hunter and builder

**Time disappears when:**
- Reviewing deals
- Closing
- Designing scalable systems
- Creating content

---

## 8. What Drains You?

**Activities:**
- Fulfillment
- Retail emotional drag
- Low-leverage admin
- Spreadsheet-heavy engineering
- Over-tinkering

**Framework:**
- Does NOT like managing emotions → likes solving numbers
- Does NOT like maintaining systems → likes building and installing them

---

## 9. What Are You Doing Because You "Should"?

- Document prep
- Email micromanagement
- Certain system tweaks that feel productive but aren't revenue moving

**What's needed:**
- TC ($300/deal = cheap leverage)
- VA repositioned toward buyer acquisition + admin
- Clear escalation rules (so Jonathan doesn't default to closing everything)

---

## 10. If You Could Only Do 2–3 Things Daily?

**Originally said:**
1. Train/invest in team
2. Underwrite deals
3. Create content

**Updated (refined):**
1. **Underwrite & close high-signal deals**
2. **Train LM on conversion & decision speed**
3. **Install scalable bot infrastructure** (in a defined time block)
4. Build buyer/capital relationships
5. Create content (positioning + leverage)

**Core insight:** Bot installation is leverage. But it must live inside a container. It cannot replace closing as priority.

---

## The Real Gaps (Without Interpretation, Just Observation)

1. **No clean source tracking**
2. **No clean LM conversion metric**
3. **No buyer depth metric**
4. **No defined "bot success KPI"**
5. **Jonathan is still the highest converter in the system**
6. **No TC yet**
7. **Infrastructure is being built while revenue is still scaling**
