# 2025-02-12 - Memory Log

## System Setup Progress

### Completed Today
- **Mission Control Dashboard**: Next.js project initialized at `/Users/alfred/.openclaw/workspace/mission-control` (TypeScript + Tailwind, 5-column Kanban)
- **MISSION_CONTROL.md**: Markdown kanban created with columns: QUEUED → THIS WEEK → IN FLIGHT → BLOCKED → DONE (color-coded by category)
- **Content Production**: 3 weekend Reel scripts delivered and ready to film:
  - Saturday: "Why Agents Stay Broke"
  - Sunday: "Masculine Jesus" + "First Wholesale Deal"
- **Daily Automation**: Morning brief cron scheduled (6 AM EST), format includes news story + business optimization + tasks + 4-5 high-leverage AI tasks
- **ClawHub**: Authenticated (@meetjonathansmith)
- **Todoist**: Skill installed and operational
- **YouTube Framework Library**: 20 frameworks + 5 templates delivered
- **Enhanced Weekly Review Template**: Drafted (includes margin tracking, DTA metrics, closed income, risk zones, time allocation)

### Critical Blocker
**Brave Search API Key Missing** - blocks:
- Reddit audience research agent
- Automated morning briefs
- Content research agents
- All web-based automation

### Deadline
**Sunday** - All APIs and configurations must be complete (Brave, Discord bot, Twitter)

### Next Actions
1. Complete Next.js Mission Control UI (Kanban components)
2. Sync web interface with MISSION_CONTROL.md data
3. Save enhanced weekly review template as `WEEKLY_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md`
4. Write captions + hashtags for 3 weekend Reels
5. Wait for Jonathan to configure APIs by Sunday
6. Once APIs live: relaunch Reddit agent, enable automated briefs, activate Discord content factory

### Strategic Context
- **Instagram target**: 10k followers, minimum 1 post/day
- **Business model**: DTA (Direct-to-Agent), 70%+ margin standard, closed income only
- **Positioning**: Kingdom operator + neuroscience + real estate (NOT "another REI creator")
- **Communication style**: Paul writing to Corinth - direct, no fluff, lead with answer

### Key File Locations
- Mission Control web app: `/Users/alfred/.openclaw/workspace/mission-control`
- Mission Control markdown: `/Users/alfred/.openclaw/workspace/MISSION_CONTROL.md`
- Strategic docs: SOUL.md, USER.md, REVENUE.md, EXECUTION.md (all confirmed in workspace)
