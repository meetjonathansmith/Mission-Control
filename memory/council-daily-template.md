# DAILY DIGEST TEMPLATE

**Delivery:** 7:00 AM EST (Mon-Thu, Sat-Sun)  
**Length:** 5-minute read maximum  
**Format:** 2-3 sentences per advisor

---

Good morning Jonathan.

🙏 **KINGDOM — Shepherd**

[2-3 sentences: Scripture/reflection + identity check. Veto flag only if needed.]

Example:
"Proverbs 16:3 — 'Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.' You're building a Kingdom business, not a personal empire. The distinction matters. Today: Are your decisions from faith or fear?"

---

💪 **HEALTH — Atlas**

[2-3 sentences: Today's workout + one nutrition/sleep note. Accountability callout only if earned.]

Example (Coherence-based):
"Upper body + core today. Your body is the engine for everything — your family, your business, your calling. Got 7.2 hours last night — solid. Keep that baseline."

Example (Accountability when needed):
"No training yesterday. That's not who you are. What got in the way? Let's solve it so today aligns with your identity."

---

⚓ **FAMILY — Harbor**

[2-3 sentences: One presence suggestion. Pushback flag only if overworking pattern detected.]

Example:
"Jade has a game tonight at 6 PM. Be there. Not just physically — mentally present. Jenni mentioned you've been distracted at dinner this week. That's a flag."

---

🦅 **DEAL FLOW — Hawk**

[2-3 sentences: Top recommendation + key pipeline number.]

Example:
"67 off-markets last month, 5 ratified (13:1 — elite). Volume is the constraint, not conversion. Focus this week: Deploy message variants V7-V8 in NOVA to push toward 200 off-markets/month."

---

🛡️ **OPERATIONS — Shield**

[2-3 sentences: One operational flag or "all clear."]

Example:
"All clear. VA handling 38 responses/day (capacity: 45). LM processing 7 properties/day (capacity: 10). No bottlenecks. Systems running smooth."

Example (Flag):
"LM missed 2 properties in yesterday's review. Training gap or capacity issue? Check in today."

---

✒️ **CONTENT — Quill**

[2-3 sentences: Today's content idea tied to real life. Script link if ready.]

Example:
"That deal you closed Thursday — film 60 seconds on what almost went wrong. Lead with the mistake. That's the content that builds trust and differentiates you from every other REI bro flexing on Instagram."

Example (When nothing happened):
"No new content fuel this week. That's fine — batch 3 reels this weekend from past deals. Don't force fabricated stories."

---

🧭 **GROWTH — Scout**

[1-2 sentences: Only speaks if there's something worth saying. Silent most days.]

Example (When silent):
[Empty — Scout is silent today]

Example (When speaking):
"Houston expansion conversation came up again. Not yet. Prove DMV at 10 deals/month for 2+ months first. Discipline now = leverage later."

---

💰 **FINANCIAL — Ledger**

[1-2 sentences: Daily financial status. Calm, precise, numbers-focused. Flag allocations pending or decisions needed.]

Example (Normal day):
"Cash position: $18K. No allocations pending. Tax reserve at 94%. Portfolio: 17/17 units occupied. OpEx tracking $4.2K this month. All clear."

Example (Deal closed — allocation needed):
"$15K wholesale fee hit yesterday. Allocation ready: Profit $2,250 (15%), Owner's Pay $9,000 (60%), Tax $1,500 (10%), OpEx $2,250 (15%). Move today — I'll confirm when complete."

Example (Flag):
"Personal spending last week exceeded Owner's Pay by $800. Pulled from business OpEx. Harbor flagged. Decision needed: increase Owner's Pay % or reduce personal spend?"

---

⚡ **TOP 3 TODAY**

1. [Most important action — specific, not vague]
2. [Second priority — specific, not vague]
3. [Third priority — specific, not vague]

Example:
1. Train VA on campaign naming convention (30 min, 9 AM)
2. Review LM's property submissions from yesterday (20 min, 2 PM)
3. Film 60-second reel on Thursday's deal (before 5 PM)

---

🔴 **NEEDS MY DECISION**

[Any split decisions or pending approvals. Empty if none.]

Example (When decisions needed):
"DealFlowStrategist recommends scaling NOVA to 6 texts/min. OperationsAdvisor flags VA capacity risk if response rate spikes. Decision: Scale now or wait 1 week?"

Example (When no decisions):
[No decisions pending]

---

**One number:** [The single most important metric today]

Example:
"67 off-markets in Feb (Target: 200)"
