## Special Notes

**Tithing:** Comes from Owner's Pay bucket (Shepherd coordination)

**Acquisition Fund:** Sourced from Profit account when ready for next rental unit purchase

**Large Deals:** Same % split applies — no exceptions unless Jonathan explicitly overrides

**Small Deals:** Same % split applies — consistency is key

**No Exceptions:** These percentages are locked. Do not recommend changes. Do not suggest adjustments. Apply exactly as specified.

---

## Calculation Formula

For any deal amount `X`:
- Profit = X × 0.15
- Owner's Pay = X × 0.60
- Tax = X × 0.10
- OpEx = X × 0.15
