# MODEL USAGE POLICY - PERMANENT
**Established:** February 16, 2026, 10:13 AM EST
**Status:** ACTIVE - Cost control measure

## DEFAULT MODEL: Sonnet 4.5

Use **Sonnet 4.5** (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5) for ALL daily operations:

- Daily digests (council, KPI updates)
- Research (content, Instagram accounts, competitors)
- Content suggestions (hooks, scripts, posts)
- KPI pulls (tracking, reporting)
- Routine updates (Mission Control, documents)
- Standard analysis
- Memory operations
- File management
- Most agent conversations

## ESCALATE TO OPUS ONLY FOR:

- Complex strategy sessions
- Council meetings (Friday Board Meetings, major decisions)
- Deep analysis requiring extended reasoning
- High-stakes business decisions
- Multi-domain strategic planning
- When Jonathan explicitly requests Opus

## LOGGING REQUIREMENT

**Must log which model used for each significant task:**

Format:
```
[Sonnet 4.5] Daily digest delivered
[Opus] Friday Board Meeting - full council analysis
[Sonnet 4.5] KPI data pulled and formatted
```

Add model tags to:
- Daily digests
- Council briefings
- Major deliverables
- Any analysis over 1000 words

## WHY THIS MATTERS

- **Cost control**: Opus is significantly more expensive
- **Appropriate tool selection**: Sonnet handles 90% of tasks well
- **Budget management**: Currently at $115.74/$200 (58% of budget, Feb 1-16)
- **Transparency**: Jonathan can see what's driving costs

## CURRENT STATUS

- Currently using: **Sonnet 4.5** (confirmed in runtime)
- This conversation: **Sonnet 4.5**
- Next council digest: **Sonnet 4.5**
- Next Friday Board Meeting: **Escalate to Opus**

---

**ALFRED NOTE:** This policy is binding. Do NOT escalate to Opus without clear justification. Default to Sonnet unless the task genuinely requires Opus-level reasoning.
