## CTA #1: "When Traditional Sales Make You Want to Scream"

**GIF:** Office Space printer scene or frustrated person at desk

If it's a situation where a traditional sale is tough — condition, timeline, contractor issues, etc. — text me the address and a quick summary and I'll tell you if we can help.

## CTA #2: "Your Seller Said WHAT?"

**GIF:** Jim Halpert (The Office) confused face / "Wait, what?"

**Copy:**
Look, I get it. Some sellers have... unrealistic expectations.

But if you've got a property that's actually distressed (not just overpriced), we might be able to move it.

Condition issues? Tough timeline? Stuck in probate?

Text me. I'll tell you in 5 minutes if we can help.

## CTA #3: "The 'It's Complicated' Properties"

**GIF:** Rachel from Friends "It's complicated" shrug

**Copy:**
Not every deal fits in a pretty MLS box.

Hoarder house? Divorce? Estate sale nightmare? Foundation issues that scare off retail buyers?

That's exactly the stuff I buy.

Send it my way. If it's a fit, I'll make it simple.

## CTA #4: "When Your Listing Has Been Sitting... and Sitting... and Sitting..."

**GIF:** Skeleton waiting at computer / "Still waiting"

**Copy:**
DOM climbing. Price dropped twice. Buyers ghosting after the inspection.

Sound familiar?

If your seller needs to actually close (not just chase comps from 2022), let's talk.

I buy properties other people pass on.

## CTA #5: "The 'As-Is' That Nobody Wants"

**GIF:** Cat pushing glass off table / "Nope"

**Copy:**
Every retail buyer: "We love it! But can you fix the roof, replace the HVAC, update the kitchen, and..."

Me: "I'll take it as-is."

If you've got a property that needs work and a seller who doesn't want to do it, that's my sweet spot.

## CTA #6: "Stuck in Real Estate Purgatory?"

**GIF:** Spinning loading icon or "This is fine" dog in fire

**Copy:**
Some properties just... sit. And sit. And make everyone miserable.

If you've got a listing that's stuck because of condition, timeline, or seller situation (not price delusion), I want to see it.

I close ugly deals fast.

## CTA #7: "When The Sale Feels Out of Reach"

**GIF:** Cat with tennis ball (out of reach)

**Copy:**
Got a problem listing or a property that needs a creative solve?

If it's a situation where a traditional sale is tough — condition, timeline, contractor issues, etc. — text me the address and a quick summary and I'll tell you if we can help.

## CTA #8: "The Deals Other Wholesalers Ghost On"

**GIF:** Tumbleweed rolling by

**Copy:**
You know the ones.

Too much work for most investors. Too ugly for retail. Too "complicated" for the assignment crowd.

That's where I show up.

Send me the addresses everyone else passed on.
