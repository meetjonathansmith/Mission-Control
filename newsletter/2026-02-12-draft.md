# The Smith Letter - February 12, 2026 DRAFT

---

## Opening

The market doesn't reward certainty anymore. It rewards accurate prediction.

Your brain is a prediction engine. It takes past outcomes, current conditions, and threat models—and renders a version of reality that feels "obvious" to you. That's why the same jobs report can look like stabilization to one investor and stagnation to another.

Different models. Different renders. Different decisions.

Here's the edge: the faster you update your model with real feedback, the better your predictions become. Every comp you run, every offer you make, every acceptance or rejection—that's training data. Over time, what used to feel risky starts to feel normal. Not because the market changed, but because your internal GPS got better.

That's what this letter is for—helping you predict more accurately.

Let's look at what moved last week.

## What's Moving the Market

### Jobs Report Beats Expectations, But Fed Stays Put

The January jobs report finally arrived after delays from the government shutdown, exceeding expectations with 130,000 jobs added—more than double the 55,000 estimate. Unemployment edged down to 4.3% from 4.4%. Job growth was concentrated in healthcare (+82,000), social assistance (+42,000), and construction (+33,000), while federal government (-34,000) and financial activities (-22,000) contracted. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4%, bringing annual wage growth to 3.7%.

Why it matters:

Markets don't need rate cuts as much as they need predictability. This report keeps the Fed in wait-and-see mode through March, with June the likely window for any rate action. Real estate pricing responds to expectations long before official rate changes.

### Senior Home Equity Hits Record $14.66 Trillion as Trump Opposes Price Declines

Housing wealth held by homeowners age 62 and older climbed to a record $14.66 trillion in Q3 2025, a 1.9% quarterly increase. President Trump made his position clear: he doesn't want housing prices to fall, prioritizing existing homeowners who've benefited from appreciation over younger buyers locked out of tight markets. In 2024, 81% of Trump voters were homeowners. Research shows sellers in their 70s and older consistently receive lower returns—about 0.5% less per year, or roughly $20,000 less on a $400,000 home over an 11-year hold.

Why it matters:

Older sellers prioritize speed and simplicity over maximum value, selling off-MLS and taking first offers more often. If you're positioned to provide certainty and a clean close, that's your edge.

### Foreclosure Filings Up 32% Year-Over-Year, Eleventh Straight Monthly Increase

Foreclosure activity continued climbing in January, with 40,534 U.S. properties receiving foreclosure filings—down 10% from December but up 32% from January 2025. This marks the eleventh consecutive month of year-over-year increases. Maryland posted one of the highest foreclosure rates at 1 in 2,430 housing units, ranking fifth nationally behind Delaware, Nevada, Florida, and South Carolina. Lenders initiated foreclosure on 26,369 properties (up 26% annually), while completed foreclosures totaled 4,714 (up 59% year-over-year).

Why it matters:

Eleven straight months of increases signals sustained pressure, not seasonal noise. Foreclosure pipelines are filling, but inventory isn't flooding yet—that lag creates opportunity for operators who can move fast on pre-foreclosure deals before institutional buyers scale up.

## What's Worth Watching

### Trump Administration Explores "Trump Homes" Rent-to-Own Program

Shares of Lennar jumped last week after Bloomberg reported the builder is exploring a large-scale rent-to-own program dubbed "Trump Homes." The concept: builders sell newly built entry-level homes to private investors, who rent them to tenants with part of the monthly rent credited toward a future down payment. In some versions, renters could purchase after about three years. Bloomberg reports the program could eventually involve up to one million homes, though the White House hasn't formally endorsed the plan.

Why it matters:

If scaled, this creates a new institutional asset class and opens capital deployment for operators who can structure deals with builders. It's an access solution, not a demand solution—exactly what builders need in a high-rate environment.

### Apartment Demand Concentrates in Select Markets as National Activity Cools

The U.S. apartment market saw net move-outs for the first time in three years in Q4 2025, according to RealPage data—a return to typical seasonal patterns rather than a breakdown. Out of the 50 largest apartment markets, only 14 posted positive absorption. Just four absorbed more than 1,000 units: New York (~4,300, 97% occupancy), Phoenix (~4,000), Fort Worth (~1,500, but occupancy under 93%), and Newark (~1,400, 96%+ occupancy). Columbus was the lone Midwest market with positive demand (~500 units).

Why it matters:

National headlines don't tell the whole story—demand is concentrating in markets with strong job bases and limited supply. Local fundamentals matter more than macro narratives.

### Single-Family Construction Permits Fall 9.4% as Builders Pull Back

Single-family construction permits declined 9.4% over the past year to an annual rate of 876,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The slowdown reflects tighter financing, elevated costs, and weaker buyer demand. Even as senior housing wealth hits records and the labor market stabilizes, builders aren't rushing to add supply. The pullback is most pronounced in overbuilt Sunbelt markets where inventory surged in 2023-2024.

Why it matters:

Less supply today means tighter inventory 12-18 months from now. Builders don't reverse course quickly—today's pullback impacts 2026-2027 availability, creating a narrowing window to acquire quality inventory before supply constraints push pricing higher.

## Jon's Take

This doesn't feel like a breakout year. And it doesn't feel like a breakdown year.

It feels like a **sorting year**.

The labor market is stabilizing, not surging. Foreclosures are rising, but not flooding. Seniors hold record equity, but can't extract maximum value. Apartment demand is concentrating, not expanding. Builders are pulling back, not rushing in.

Policy is caught between two impossible mandates: make housing affordable while keeping prices high. That tension creates friction, delays, and uncertainty—which separates disciplined operators from opportunistic ones.

Here's what matters:

Foreclosure pipelines are filling slowly. That lag creates pre-foreclosure opportunity before institutional buyers scale up. Senior sellers prioritize speed over price—off-MLS deals and clean closes win. Supply pullback today means tighter inventory in 12-18 months. And if rent-to-own scales, it's a new asset class for operators who can structure creative deals with builders.

If there's an edge right now, it's not information. Everyone has the same data.

**It's discipline.**

The ability to underwrite accurately when others are guessing. To move decisively when others are paralyzed. To structure deals when others are waiting for "normal" to return.

That's how I'm approaching 2026: positioned to capitalize no matter which way it goes.

And if you're an agent sitting on off-market inventory, distressed listings, or sellers who need speed over price? That's exactly the kind of deal flow I'm built for.
