# SUNDAY WEEK AHEAD BRIEFING
**Week of February 16-22, 2026**  
**Delivered:** Sunday, February 15, 6:00 PM EST

Good evening, Jonathan.

This week you attack the main constraint: 67 off-markets → 200 off-markets.

Monday and Tuesday are foundation days. Wednesday-Saturday you build.

---

## 🙏 SHEPHERD — Spiritual Focus for the Week

**Scripture for the Week:**

Proverbs 21:5 — *"The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty."*

**The Message:**

This week isn't about heroics. It's about disciplined execution.

You're building a system that produces consistent results. Monday you audit (spam, attribution). Tuesday you scale (dormant purge, send rates, message refresh). Wednesday-Saturday you execute the content calendar and train your team.

Haste = chasing shiny objects, skipping steps, hoping for breakthroughs.

Diligence = doing the unsexy work that compounds.

Spam audits aren't exciting. Attribution systems aren't glamorous. Dormant agent purges don't feel like growth.

But they ARE growth. They're the foundation that lets you scale from 67 to 200 off-markets without collapsing.

**Identity checkpoint:**

You're not a hustler chasing deals. You're a steward building a Kingdom business that feeds your family, funds your calling, and creates freedom for others.

That requires discipline, not intensity.

**Prayer focus this week:**

Wisdom in execution. Patience when results lag. Gratitude for what's already working (13:1 conversion is elite — most operators would kill for that).

- **Tomorrow (Monday):** Light walk or full rest. Let nervous system recover.

**Tuesday (Feb 17):** UPPER BODY (Chest + Back)

- **Duration:** 45-50 min
- **Cardio:** Optional 10K steps

**Sunday (Feb 22):** REST
- Sabbath — no training
- Family time, church, rest

### Nutrition Plan (2,300 cal baseline)

**Daily macros:**
- Protein: 205g
- Carbs: ~200g
- Fats: ~70g
- Fiber: 30g+
- Water: 1 gallon

**Meal structure (current sustainable rhythm):**

**Lunch (daily):**
- 1 cup egg whites
- 0.5 cup egg substitute
- Handful fat-free cheese
- Heaping spoonful 2% cottage cheese

**Dinner (rotate):**
- 7-10 oz lean protein (chicken, ground beef, salmon, shrimp)
- 1-1.5 cups carbs (white rice, jasmine rice, sweet potato, mashed potatoes)
- 1 tbsp butter or healthy fat

**Snacks:**
- 2 Creamis per day (50g protein each, skim milk, handful M&Ms or Captain Crunch)
- Smart Pop popcorn if hungry (100 cal bags, 2 max)
- Handful almonds if needed

**Non-negotiables:**
- 1 Creami minimum per day (protein ice cream = sustainable)
- Protein within 90 min post-workout
- No alcohol (you're crushing it — 243.6 lbs, down from 266.9 starting weight)

**Weight check-in:**
- Daily weigh-ins (morning, post-bathroom)
- Track in Whoop or notes
- Weekly avg matters more than daily fluctuations

**Atlas says:**

You're down 23+ lbs since start. Your training is smart (you dropped weight when form broke on leg curls — that's discipline). Sleep is improving (7h56m last night). Recovery is green.

This week = maintain the rhythm. Don't chase hero lifts. Don't add volume. Your body is adapting. Let it.

When you hit 230 lbs, we'll reassess and potentially add a small calorie bump. For now, 2,300 cal is working. Stay the course.

## ⚓ HARBOR — Family & Presence Goals

### Family Calendar This Week

**Monday (Feb 16):**
- Business launch day (spam audit, attribution system)
- Home by 6 PM for dinner with Jenni and kids
- No work talk at dinner table

**Tuesday (Feb 17):**
- LM training 3-5 PM (2 hours)
- Home by 6 PM for dinner
- Check in with Jade — how's school this week?

**Wednesday (Feb 18):**
- Film Agent Freedom content (first dedicated post)
- Family dinner — be present

**Thursday (Feb 19):**
- Normal work schedule
- Family dinner
- Ask Miller about school — anything coming up?

**Friday (Feb 20):**
- Friday Board Meeting (7 AM, 30 min)
- Financial sit-down with Ledger (time TBD)
- Date night with Jenni? (If not this week, schedule for next week)

**Saturday (Feb 21):**
- Training if you feel good
- Family time — no business calls
- Film 1 piece of content if inspired, but don't force it

**Sunday (Feb 22):**
- Sabbath — no work
- Church with family
- Rest, recharge, be fully present

### Presence Goals

**Jenni flagged this last week:** You've been distracted at dinner.

Business is ramping up. Deals are closing. Week 1 is a sprint.

But Jenni's peace > your profit. Always.

**This week's commitment:**
- Phone face-down during dinner (every night, non-negotiable)
- Eyes up when Jade or Miller talk to you
- Ask Jenni one question every night that has nothing to do with business: "How was your day?" "What made you smile today?" "What's on your mind?"

**Harbor's note:**

You've got 4 ratified deals in the pipeline. You closed $17K this week. You're about to attack the main constraint.

None of that matters if Jenni feels like you're mentally checked out.

Be present this week. Business can wait 30 minutes for dinner.

## 🦅 HAWK — Deal Flow Strategy

### The Main Constraint: 67 → 200 Off-Markets

**Current state:**
- 67 off-markets/month (Feb 2026)
- 4 ratified deals in pipeline
- 13:1 conversion (ELITE, beats 18-24:1 industry standard)
- Volume is the ONLY constraint

**Week 1 attack plan:**

**MONDAY (Feb 16) — FOUNDATION DAY**

1. **Spam Audit (9-11 AM)**
   - Pull all current SC message templates
   - Audit against Section 6 checklist (SC Operations Manual)
   - Flag anything risky, deliver cleaned versions by EOD
   - No campaigns launch without audit approval
   - **Owner:** Shield + VA, Alfred delivers to you for approval

2. **Attribution System Deployment (11 AM - 12 PM)**
   - Implement naming convention: `MARKET-YEAR-W##-TYPE-V#`
   - Train VA on system (30 min)
   - Example: `NOVA-2026-W08-Initial-V7`
   - **Owner:** Alfred trains VA, Shield monitors

3. **Announce MD 4-Week Rest (12-1 PM)**
   - Pause all MD campaigns (22,270 agents)
   - Let list rest, recover deliverability
   - Come back stronger in March (peak season)
   - **Owner:** Shield executes, you approve

**TUESDAY (Feb 17) — SCALE DAY**

4. **Dormant Agent Purge (9-11 AM)**
   - Identify: 20+ lifetime touches, zero response
   - Move to dormant list
   - Report: How many freed? What % of list?
   - **Purpose:** Free send volume for active agents
   - **Owner:** Shield + VA execute, Hawk analyzes

5. **Increase Send Rates (11 AM - 12 PM)**
   - NOVA: 4/min → 6/min
   - Richmond: → 5/min
   - Monitor delivery rate for 48 hours
   - If >95% → keep. If drops → revert.
   - **Owner:** Shield monitors, Hawk tracks response

6. **Deploy Message Variants V7-V8 (1-3 PM)**
   - Launch `NOVA-2026-W08-Initial-V7`
   - Launch `RVA-2026-W08-FU1-V8`
   - 20-variant library (Appendix C) gives rotation
   - **Owner:** Shield executes, Hawk tracks metrics

7. **Train LM on 20-Minute Review Protocol (3-5 PM)**
   - 2-hour training session
   - Selectivity model from September
   - Goal: Keep 13:1 elite conversion as volume scales
   - Current capacity: 7 properties/day → Target: 10/day
   - **Owner:** You train LM

### The Math (Why This Works)

**Week 1 expected impact:**
- Dormant purge frees send capacity
- Send rate increases: +30% text volume (48K → 62K/month)
- Message refresh combats fatigue
- **Expected:** 62K texts × 1.0% response × 24% conv→off-market = **149 off-markets**

**Week 5-8 (March peak season):**
- MD comes back rested
- Scale to 70K texts/month
- Seasonal lift (March-May = peak)
- **Target:** 200+ off-markets/month

**Hawk says:**

You're not broken. You're starving the funnel. This week we fix that.

Monday-Tuesday = foundation + scale. Wednesday-Saturday = execute and monitor.

Your 13:1 conversion is elite. We just need to feed it 3x more off-markets.

**Week 1 target: 149 off-markets. Let's hunt.**

## 🛡️ SHIELD — Operations Readiness

### Week 1 Operational Status

**Current capacity:**
- VA: 38 responses/day (capacity: 45) — healthy buffer
- LM: 7 properties/day (capacity: 10) — room to grow
- Text infrastructure: 97% delivery (excellent)
- List health: Some dormant weight, will purge Tuesday

**Week 1 operational plan:**

**Monday:**
- Coordinate spam audit with VA (9-11 AM)
- Train VA on attribution system (11 AM - 12 PM, 30 min session)
- Execute MD rest announcement (coordinate with Hawk)
- **Deliverable:** Cleaned templates to Jonathan by 5 PM

**Tuesday:**
- Execute dormant agent purge with VA (9-11 AM)
- Monitor send rate increases (NOVA 6/min, Richmond 5/min)
- Deploy message variants V7-V8 (1-3 PM)
- **48-hour watch:** Delivery rate monitoring (must stay >95%)

**Wednesday-Saturday:**
- Monitor campaign performance (response rate, delivery, off-market submissions)
- Daily check-ins with VA/LM on capacity
- Flag any bottlenecks immediately

**Shield says:**

All systems green. VA and LM have capacity for volume increase.

Monday-Tuesday will be intense (audit, attribution, purge, scale, deploy). But the team is ready.

No bottlenecks detected. Infrastructure can handle the load.

**Week 1 = foundation work. Let's build it right.**

## ✒️ QUILL — Content Calendar (Week 1)

### The New Reality: Agent Freedom = The Brand (25%)

**Updated pillar distribution:**
1. Faith in the Fight: 25%
2. **Agent Freedom: 25%** (STRATEGIC PRIORITY)
3. Documenting the Climb: 20%
4. Starting Over at 43: 10%
5. Leading Men: 10%
6. Contrarian Takes: 10%

**Why Agent Freedom matters most:**

Every agent who follows you because content helped them = potential off-market deal source.

You made $120K from ONE video. That's the proof.

This week you launch Agent Freedom as a strategic priority.

---

### Week 1 Content Calendar (Mon-Sat)

**MONDAY, FEB 16 — Faith in the Fight**

**Hook options (pick 1):**
- "Proverbs 21:5 — The plans of the diligent lead to profit. This week I'm doing the unsexy work."
- "You know what's not sexy? Auditing spam filters and purging dormant contacts. But that's how you build a real business."
- "Haste leads to poverty. Diligence leads to profit. This week = foundation, not fireworks."

**Talking points:**
- Monday is spam audit day (not exciting, but necessary)
- Kingdom business = disciplined execution, not heroics
- Show the unglamorous work (you at desk, spreadsheets, VA training)
- BTS of what "building a business" actually looks like

**Format:** Reel (60 sec) or Carousel (5 slides)

---

**TUESDAY, FEB 17 — Documenting the Climb**

**Hook options:**
- "Today I'm training my Lead Manager on a 20-minute property review protocol. Here's why that matters."
- "We're scaling from 67 to 200 off-markets per month. That means my team needs to get faster without losing quality."
- "Most people think scaling = more ads. Wrong. Scaling = better systems."

**Talking points:**
- Training LM today (3-5 PM)
- Volume is coming — team needs to be ready
- Systems > intensity
- BTS of actual training session (if you film it)

**Format:** Reel (60 sec)

---

**WEDNESDAY, FEB 18 — Agent Freedom (FIRST DEDICATED POST)**

**Hook options:**
- "I sold $80M in real estate as a listing agent and owned nothing. Here's what I'd change."
- "Real estate agents have more access to deals than any investor. But they sell everything to other people and keep nothing."
- "I used to work 70-hour weeks showing houses. Now I have 17 rental units and work less. Here's what changed."

**Talking points:**
- You were a high-volume listing agent ($80M+ in sales)
- Grinding, exhausted, owned NOTHING
- Solved it: 17 rental units now (passive income)
- eXp Realty: Every recruit = $8K/year passive (target: 10 agents, $80K this year)
- **The thesis:** Agents have deal access but keep nothing. I want to change that.
- This is about serving agents, not recruiting them (empathy first)

**Format:** Reel (60-90 sec) — this one can be longer, it's your origin story

**Quill's note:**

This is THE content that attracts agents who send you deals. It's authentic (you lived it), empathetic (you know the grind), and valuable (you solved the problem).

Don't pitch. Document. Share your story.

---

**THURSDAY, FEB 19 — Documenting the Climb OR Agent Freedom (Your choice)**

**Option A — Documenting:**
- "We just finished Week 1 of our scale plan. Here's what happened."
- Show the results: response rates, off-markets, what worked, what didn't
- BTS of looking at campaign data with VA/LM

**Option B — Agent Freedom:**
- "The #1 mistake agents make: chasing every listing instead of keeping the best ones for yourself."
- Teach one tactical thing (how to identify which listings to keep vs. sell)
- Position yourself as someone who's been there and knows the path

**Format:** Reel (60 sec)

---

**FRIDAY, FEB 20 — Faith in the Fight**

**Hook options:**
- "Exodus 23:30 — 'I will drive them out little by little.' That's my operating Scripture right now."
- "God doesn't rush. He builds. This week I learned that again."
- "I used to think bigger = faster. Now I know bigger = better systems."

**Talking points:**
- Reflect on the week (Monday spam audit, Tuesday scale, what you learned)
- Kingdom business = patient execution, not haste
- Gratitude for what's working (13:1 conversion, 4 deals in pipeline)

**Format:** Carousel (3-5 slides) or Reel (60 sec)

---

**SATURDAY, FEB 21 — Starting Over at 43 OR Leading Men OR Contrarian Take**

**Option A — Starting Over at 43:**
- "I'm 47. I started over at 43 with a wife, 3 kids, and a dream. Here's what I've learned."
- Personal story, vulnerability, encouragement for others betting on themselves later in life

**Option B — Leading Men:**
- "What does Biblical masculinity actually look like? Not what Instagram tells you."
- Tie to real life: how you're leading your family this week, or men's Bible study insight

**Option C — Contrarian Take:**
- "Everyone says 'hustle harder.' I say build better systems."
- Challenge conventional REI wisdom with your experience

**Format:** Reel (60 sec) or Carousel (3-5 slides)

---

### Quill's Quality Bar (Non-Negotiable)

Every script you film this week must pass these filters:

1. **Document, don't preach** — Is this from your actual life, or is it generic advice?
2. **Truth over flex** — Are you sharing wins AND losses, or just highlight reel?
3. **Appropriate transparency** — Are you being real without oversharing?
4. **Voice check** — Does this sound like YOU, or like every other REI creator?

**If a script doesn't pass all 4, don't post it.**

**Quill says:**

This week you're launching Agent Freedom as a strategic priority. Wednesday's post is critical — it's your origin story, your credibility, your empathy for agents.

Film it when you're not rushed. Glance at talking points, hit record, speak from the heart.

The rest of the week = document what you're actually doing (Monday audit, Tuesday scale, Friday reflection).

**Quality > quantity. Every piece of content should feel like something you WANT to post, not something you're obligated to post.**

---

## 🔭 SCOUT — Growth Advisory

Scout is mostly silent this week. Execution > expansion.

**One note:**

Houston keeps coming up in conversations. Not yet.

Prove DMV at 10 deals/month for 2+ consecutive months first. Target: June 2026.

Week 1 is about fixing the constraint (67 → 200 off-markets). Stay focused.

Discipline now = leverage later.

## 💰 LEDGER — Financial Strategy

### FIRST PRIORITY TASK: Profit First Account Structure Audit

**Current situation:**
- Partial setup at Chase/BofA
- $17K deal closed this week (awaiting allocation)
- $25K in business checking before allocation
- $8K will remain after allocation

**Your locked allocation percentages:**
- Profit: 15%
- Owner's Pay: 60%
- Tax: 10%
- OpEx: 15%

**Ledger's audit and recommendation:**

Based on your Profit First system and locked percentages, here's the exact account structure you need:

### Required Accounts at Chase/BofA

**1. INCOME ACCOUNT (Already exists)**
- Name: "DOXA Income" or "Business Checking"
- Purpose: All revenue hits here first
- Action: Within 24 hours of deal closing, move money OUT to allocation accounts
- **This account should trend toward $0 after allocations**

**2. PROFIT ACCOUNT (Need to open)**
- Name: "DOXA Profit" or "Profit Reserve"
- Purpose: Business profit, acquisition fund for next rental unit, emergency reserves
- Allocation: 15% of every deal
- **Example:** $17K deal = $2,550 moves here
- **Target balance:** Let this grow. Don't touch unless:
  - Acquiring next rental unit
  - True business emergency
  - Quarterly profit distributions (if you choose)

**3. OWNER'S PAY ACCOUNT (Need to open)**
- Name: "DOXA Owner's Pay" or "Jonathan Salary"
- Purpose: Your personal salary, family budget, tithing source
- Allocation: 60% of every deal
- **Example:** $17K deal = $10,200 moves here
- **How to use:** Transfer from this account to personal checking weekly or bi-weekly for family expenses
- **Tithing comes from here** (Shepherd coordination)

**4. TAX ACCOUNT (Need to open)**
- Name: "DOXA Tax Reserve" or "Tax Savings"
- Purpose: Quarterly estimated taxes, year-end tax bill
- Allocation: 10% of every deal
- **Example:** $17K deal = $1,700 moves here
- **Target balance:** Let this accumulate. NEVER touch except for tax payments.
- **Coordinate with tax strategist:** Quarterly payment schedule

**5. OPERATING EXPENSES ACCOUNT (Need to open)**
- Name: "DOXA OpEx" or "Operating Expenses"
- Purpose: All business expenses (VA, LM, software, SC texts, etc.)
- Allocation: 15% of every deal
- **Example:** $17K deal = $2,550 moves here
- **Actual monthly burn:** $3K/month
- **Strategy:** At 15% allocation, this account will maintain healthy buffer
- **Pay all business expenses from this account only**

---

### Implementation Timeline

**Week 1 (This Week):**
- **Monday or Tuesday:** Open 4 new accounts at Chase/BofA
  - Profit Reserve
  - Owner's Pay
  - Tax Reserve
  - Operating Expenses
- **Naming:** Use names above or customize (just be consistent)
- **Linking:** Link all to main business checking for easy transfers

**Friday (Feb 21):**
- Financial sit-down with Ledger (30-45 min)
- Review account structure
- Confirm all accounts opened
- Set up recurring transfer process (how you'll move money after each deal)

---

### Allocation Process (Starting Now)

**When a deal closes:**

1. Revenue hits Income/Checking account
2. Within 24 hours, Ledger tells you exact allocation:
   - "Move $X to Profit, $X to Owner's Pay, $X to Tax, $X to OpEx"
3. You execute transfers via online banking
4. Confirm with Ledger when complete
5. Ledger logs allocation in tracker

**Your $17K deal (awaiting allocation):**
- Profit: $2,550
- Owner's Pay: $10,200
- Tax: $1,700
- OpEx: $2,550

**Action:** As soon as accounts are open, move these amounts. Until then, keep $17K in checking and track mentally.

---

### 2026 Financial Projections (Preliminary)

**If you hit 10 deals/month at $17K average:**
- Monthly revenue: $170K
- Annual revenue: $2.04M
- Annual allocations:
  - Profit: $306K (15%)
  - Owner's Pay: $1.224M (60%)
  - Tax: $204K (10%)
  - OpEx: $306K (15%)

**Owner's Pay breakdown:**
- $1.224M / 12 months = $102K/month
- After tithing (10% = $10.2K/month), you keep $91.8K/month for family

**Ledger says:**

At current trajectory (4 ratified deals in pipeline, Week 1 volume scale launching), you're on track for 6-8 deals/month by March.

If you hit 10 deals/month by June (target), you'll clear $100K/month Owner's Pay easily.

**Priority this week:** Open the 4 accounts. Then we can start proper allocation tracking.

- Send rates scale to 6/min NOVA, 5/min Richmond
- Message refresh combats fatigue
- Delivery stays >95%

**If you hit 149, you're on pace for 200+ by Week 5-8 (March peak season).**

---

## 🙏 CLOSING — Shepherd

Jonathan,

This week you do the unsexy work that compounds.

Spam audits. Dormant purges. Attribution systems. LM training.

None of it feels like "growth." But all of it IS growth.

Proverbs 21:5 — The plans of the diligent lead to profit.

You're not chasing deals. You're building a system that produces them consistently.

You're not hustling. You're stewarding.

That's Kingdom business.

**Go build.**
