## TOP 5 POSTS TO FILM FIRST

If you want to batch just a few to test:

### 1. **Day 1 (Monday) — Kingdom Business**
**Hook:** "I sold $80M in real estate and owned nothing. Then God showed me what I was actually building."  
**Why:** This is YOUR origin story. Sets the tone for everything.

### 2. **Day 2 (Tuesday) — DTA Machine**
**Hook:** "We made $120K from ONE video by doing this differently than every other wholesaler."  
**Why:** Proof + credibility. Shows the DTA model works.

### 3. **Day 3 (Wednesday) — Agent Freedom**
**Hook:** "You're sitting on off-market goldmines and selling them all to other investors. Why?"  
**Why:** Launches "Agent Freedom File" series, drives DMs.

### 4. **Day 11 (Thursday) — DTA Tactical**
**Hook:** "How I analyze an off-market deal in under 5 minutes (my exact system)"  
**Why:** High save potential, teaches the MAO formula agents NEED.

### 5. **Day 17 (Wednesday) — Agent Freedom**
**Hook:** "From $80M in sales and $0 in assets to 17 rental units: The exact turning point."

## FILMING WORKFLOW (2-Hour Batch)

**Monday Morning (Week 1 prep):**

1. **10 min:** Review scripts for Days 1-7
2. **5 min:** Set up filming location (ring light, phone on tripod, clean background)
3. **60 min:** Film all 7 videos back-to-back (same outfit, same location)
   - Record each hook 2-3 times (pick best take)
   - Keep it conversational (imagine talking to ONE agent)
   - Don't worry about perfection (authenticity > polish)
4. **30 min:** Basic editing (trim, add text overlays, export)
5. **15 min:** Schedule in Instagram/TikTok with captions + CTAs

**Total time: 2 hours for full week of content.**

## SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

After Week 1, measure these:

| Metric | What It Tells You | Target |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **3-second hold rate** | Hook effectiveness | 60%+ |
| **Saves per post** | Value/usefulness signal | 20+ per 1K views |
| **Profile visits** | Intent/consideration | 50+ per post |
| **DM volume** | Lead generation | 5-10 per day |
| **Comments** | Engagement depth | 15-30 per post |

**After Week 1:** Identify your top 3 performing hooks → Double down on those patterns in Week 2.

## ADJUSTMENTS YOU CAN MAKE

### If a post doesn't feel like "you":
- Rewrite the hook in your own words
- Change the example/story to something more recent
- Adjust the tone (more serious / more lighthearted)
- Skip it entirely and replace with an Emergency Content Idea

### If engagement is low after Week 1:
- Test bolder hooks (more specific numbers, bigger claims)
- Add more vulnerability (people connect with struggle)
- Increase posting frequency (2x/day instead of 1x)
- Engage more in comments (first 60 min critical)

### If DM volume is overwhelming:
- Create template responses for each keyword (EQUITY, SYSTEM, etc.)
- Set up GHL automation to capture leads
- Add "Reply time: 24-48 hours" to bio

---

## EMERGENCY BACKUP IDEAS

If you wake up and don't feel like filming the planned post:

1. **Deal Story** → Share ANY deal from this week (win, loss, learning)
2. **Agent Question** → Answer a real question you got this week
3. **Behind-the-Scenes** → Film your morning KPI review or property visit
4. **Scripture + Business** → Pick a verse, tie it to a recent decision
5. **Gratitude Post** → What's one win from today? (Keeps momentum)

**The calendar is a guide, not a prison.** Authenticity > perfection.

**Your competitive advantage:**
You've LIVED this. You're not teaching theory — you're documenting a real journey.

Agents will trust you because you were one.  
Investors will follow you because you're transparent.  
Believers will respect you because you lead with faith.
