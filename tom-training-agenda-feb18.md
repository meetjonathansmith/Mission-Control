## 1. Campaign Naming Convention (3 minutes)

### What You're Learning
How to name every campaign you launch in SmartContact so we can track which campaigns produce deals.

### The Format
```
[MARKET]-[YEAR]-W[WEEK#]-[TYPE]-V[MESSAGE VARIANT]
```

### Examples
- `MD-2026-W08-Initial-V1` = Maryland, 2026, Week 8, Initial contact, Message Variant 1
- `NOVA-2026-W09-FU1-V5` = Northern Virginia, 2026, Week 9, Follow-up 1, Message Variant 5
- `RVA-2026-W10-FU2-V12` = Richmond/VA Beach, 2026, Week 10, Follow-up 2, Message Variant 12

### Markets
- **MD** = Maryland
- **NOVA** = Northern Virginia
- **RVA** = Richmond/VA Beach
- **VAB** = VA Beach only (if separate campaign)

### Campaign Types
- **Initial** = First contact
- **FU1** = Follow-up 1 (14 days after initial)
- **FU2** = Follow-up 2 (28 days after initial)

### Message Variants
- V1-V20 = 20 different message templates (see Appendix C in SC Operations Manual)
- Rotate through variants, never repeat same message to same agent

### Exercise (1 minute)
**Tom, what would you name a Richmond campaign launching Week 12, Follow-up 1, using Message Variant 7?**

**Answer:** `RVA-2026-W12-FU1-V7`

## 2. SC Campaign Log Sheet (3 minutes)

### What It Is
A Google Sheet that tracks every campaign you launch. This is how we know which campaigns produce deals.

### Sheet Location
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CktoY4AGF7IS2UipUx1qllpVLttZwCoGq_yaRDig_wQ/edit

### What You Log (Every Campaign Launch)
1. **Campaign ID** (the name you just learned)
2. **Launch Date** (when you hit send)
3. **Market** (MD, NOVA, RVA)
4. **Campaign Type** (Initial, FU1, FU2)
5. **Message Variant** (V1-V20)
6. **Sender Name** (Tom, Jenny, John, Stan, Gracie, Jade)
7. **Agents Contacted** (total count from SC)
8. **Texts Sent** (actual texts sent)

### When to Update
- **At launch:** Fill in columns 1-7 (Campaign ID through Agents Contacted)
- **After campaign completes:** Fill in Texts Sent, Delivery Rate, Response Rate
- **As deals come in:** Update Off-Market Deals, Offers Sent, Ratified Deals, Closed Deals, Revenue Generated

### Example Row
```
MD-2026-W08-Initial-V1 | 2/18/2026 | MD | Initial | V1 | Tom | 22,270 | 33,146 | 97.0% | 0.78% | 258 | 72 | 20 | 3 | 1 | $17,000 | Week 1 data
```

### Exercise (1 minute)
**Tom, show me where you'd log a new campaign in the sheet. Open the sheet and add a test row.**

**Jonathan confirms:** Tom successfully adds test row, then deletes it.

## 3. Response Priority Framework (5 minutes)

### What You're Learning
When agents respond with deals, which deals do you prioritize first? Not all deals are equal.

### The Priority Order (Top to Bottom)
1. **DC-area deals** (from MD or NOVA lists) = **FIRST PRIORITY**
2. **Delaware deals** (from MD list) = **SECOND PRIORITY**
3. **MD deals** (non-DC, non-DE) = Third priority
4. **Richmond deals** = Fourth priority
5. **NOVA deals** (non-DC) = Fifth priority
6. **VA Beach deals** = Paused (investigate before resuming)

### Why This Matters
When you have 5 agents respond in one day, you need to know which ones to underwrite first. DC and Delaware deals get priority.

### How to Check Geographic Location
When an agent responds with a property:

**Step 1:** Look at the property address they send you.

**Step 2:** Check the location:
- **Washington DC proper** (any DC address) = DC-area
- **Arlington County, VA** = DC-area
- **Alexandria City, VA** = DC-area
- **Falls Church City, VA** = DC-area
- **Fairfax County, VA (inside Beltway)** = DC-area
- **Wilmington, Dover, Newark, Middletown, Smyrna, Lewes, Rehoboth Beach (Delaware)** = DE
- **Baltimore, Columbia, Frederick, Annapolis (Maryland)** = MD (non-DC, non-DE)
- **Richmond, VA Beach, Norfolk, Chesapeake** = Richmond
- **Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William (outside Beltway)** = NOVA (non-DC)

**Step 3:** Tag the deal in GHL with the correct priority tag (see section 4-5 below).

### Exercise (2 minutes)
**Jonathan gives Tom 3 sample addresses. Tom identifies the priority:**

1. "456 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22201" = **DC-area (Priority #1)**
2. "123 Main St, Wilmington, DE 19801" = **Delaware (Priority #2)**
3. "789 Park Ave, Baltimore, MD 21201" = **MD (Priority #3)**

**Tom gets all 3 correct.**

## 4. DC Wholesale-Only Rule (2 minutes)

### The Rule
**All DC-area deals = Wholesale/Dispo ONLY. No acquisitions.**

### Why
Crew constraint due to ICE enforcement. We can't execute fix-and-flip or BRRR strategies in DC area because we don't have reliable construction crews.

### What This Means for You
When a DC-area deal comes in:
1. Tag in GHL as **"DC-Wholesale"**
2. Underwrite for **wholesale spread** (quick flip margin), NOT rehab ARV
3. Do NOT ratify DC deals requiring construction/rehab
4. DO ratify DC wholesale deals (assignment to other investors, quick flip to end buyers)

### Geographic Scope of "DC Area"
- Washington DC proper
- Arlington County, VA
- Alexandria City, VA
- Falls Church City, VA
- Fairfax County, VA (portions inside Beltway)

### Exercise (30 seconds)
**Tom, agent sends you a property at "789 K Street NW, Washington DC 20001". What do you do?**

**Answer:** Tag as "DC-Wholesale", underwrite for wholesale spread only, do NOT pursue acquisition.

---

## 5. Delaware (DE) Priority Zone (2 minutes)

### The Rule
**Delaware deals = ALL DEAL TYPES ALLOWED. Second priority (after DC, before MD).**

### Why
- DE agents are inside MD list (not separate campaign)
- NO crew constraint (unlike DC) — we CAN execute fix-and-flip, BRRR, wholesale in Delaware
- Strategic expansion market close to MD/NOVA operations

### What This Means for You
When a Delaware deal comes in:
1. Tag in GHL as **"DE-Acquisition"** or **"DE-Wholesale"** (depending on strategy)
2. Underwrite for **all deal types** (fix-and-flip, BRRR, wholesale, assignment — full menu)
3. NO restrictions (unlike DC)
4. Escalate to Jonathan if **>$50K OR complex zoning** (same as MD/Richmond)

### Geographic Scope of Delaware
All three Delaware counties:
- **New Castle County** (Wilmington, Newark, Middletown)
- **Kent County** (Dover, Smyrna)
- **Sussex County** (Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach)

### Exercise (30 seconds)
**Tom, agent sends you a property at "123 Main St, Wilmington, DE 19801". What do you do?**

**Answer:** Tag as "DE-Acquisition" (or "DE-Wholesale" depending on strategy), underwrite for all deal types (acquisition allowed), Priority #2 (handle before MD deals).

## Quick Reference Card (Tom Gets This at End of Training)

### Campaign Naming Format
```
[MARKET]-[YEAR]-W[WEEK#]-[TYPE]-V[MESSAGE VARIANT]
Example: MD-2026-W08-Initial-V1
```

### Response Priority Order
1. DC-area → Tag: "DC-Wholesale" (wholesale-only)
2. Delaware → Tag: "DE-Acquisition" or "DE-Wholesale" (all deal types)
3. MD (non-DC, non-DE) → Tag: "MD-Acquisition" or "MD-Wholesale"
4. Richmond → Tag: "RVA-Acquisition" or "RVA-Wholesale"
5. NOVA (non-DC) → Tag: "NOVA-Acquisition" or "NOVA-Wholesale"

### DC-Area Cities (Wholesale-Only)
Washington DC, Arlington, Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax (inside Beltway)

### Delaware Cities (All Deal Types)
Wilmington, Dover, Newark, Middletown, Smyrna, Lewes, Rehoboth Beach

### When to Escalate to Jonathan
- DC wholesale deals: If spread >$15K
- DE/MD/Richmond/NOVA acquisition deals: If >$50K OR complex zoning
