- [ ] Clean background (simple, not distracting)
- [ ] Outfit: Casual but put-together (same for all 7 videos)

## VIDEO 1: MONDAY — Kingdom Business
**Pillar:** Kingdom Business | **Format:** Talking head + text overlay  
**Goal:** Establish your origin story + faith integration

### HOOK (Choose one, film both if unsure):
1. "I sold $80M in real estate and owned nothing. Then God showed me what I was actually building."
2. "Most agents think success = more sales. God taught me success = ownership + peace."

### TALKING POINTS (60-90 seconds):
- I was grinding 70-hour weeks, closing big deals, completely burned out
- Hit $80M in career sales but had zero assets to show for it
- Moment of clarity: I was building someone else's dream, not mine
- Started praying different prayers: "God, show me how to build with wisdom"
- He led me to rentals and revenue share — stewardship model
- Now: 17 rental units, eXp passive income, time with my family
- Same work ethic, completely different direction = Kingdom wealth

### CTA:
"If you're a believer in business, comment AMEN and tell me your biggest win this week."

**TEXT OVERLAYS (add in editing):**
- "$80M in sales"
- "$0 in assets"
- "17 rental units now"
- "Kingdom wealth ≠ broke"

---

## VIDEO 2: TUESDAY — DTA Machine
**Pillar:** DTA Machine | **Format:** Whiteboard/visual teaching  
**Goal:** Establish DTA credibility + proof of concept

### HOOK (Choose one):
1. "Real Estate Investor: Stop cold calling homeowners. Here's why agents are 20x better."
2. "We made $120K from ONE video by doing this differently than every other wholesaler."

### TALKING POINTS (60-90 seconds):
- Most investors chase homeowners directly — high resistance, low trust
- DTA = Direct-to-Agent model — peer-to-peer, relationship-first
- Agents see 100+ deals per year BEFORE they hit the market
- Our posture: Calm, curious, no pressure, serve first
- One viral video → agent reached out → sent us $120K deal
- That proved the model: Serve agents publicly, win deals privately
- Now scaling to 200 agent conversations per month

### CTA:
"Tag a real estate agent who should see this. Or DM me SYSTEM if you want the breakdown."

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- "DTA = Direct-to-Agent"
- "$120K from ONE video"
- "Serve agents = Win deals"
- "67 → 200 leads/month"

**VISUAL (if using whiteboard):**
- Draw simple funnel: Content → Agent Trust → Off-Market Deal → $$$

## VIDEO 3: WEDNESDAY — Agent Freedom
**Pillar:** Agent Freedom | **Format:** Over-the-shoulder / Direct-to-camera  
**Goal:** Launch Agent Freedom File series + drive DMs

### HOOK (Choose one):
1. "You're sitting on off-market goldmines and selling them all to other investors. Why?"
2. "Dear Real Estate Agents: You have more deal access than any investor. But you keep zero equity."

### TALKING POINTS (60-90 seconds):
- Agents see every distressed property, divorce, estate sale, motivated seller
- You list it, market it, negotiate it, close it... then hand equity to someone else
- I did this for YEARS — $80M in sales, nothing in my pocket but commissions
- What changed: I started asking "Why am I not the buyer?"
- Now I keep the best deals, partner on others, build my rental portfolio
- You don't need to quit being an agent — you need to start being an OWNER
- Simple shift: "What if I bought this one?"

### CTA:
"If you're an agent tired of watching other people build wealth, DM me EQUITY."

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- "Agent Freedom File #1"
- "You see 100+ deals/year"
- "You keep $0 equity"
- "What if YOU were the buyer?"

## VIDEO 4: THURSDAY — DTA Tactical
**Pillar:** DTA Machine | **Format:** Presentation/slideshow style  
**Goal:** Teach tactical framework (high save potential)

### HOOK (Choose one):
1. "3 things agents look for in an investor (most investors fail all 3)"
2. "Why agents ghosted you: The 3 mistakes killing your off-market pipeline"

### TALKING POINTS (60-90 seconds):
- **#1: Speed without pressure** — Agents need fast answers, not aggressive follow-ups
- **#2: Clarity** — "Can you close?" "How fast?" "What's your offer?" No vague maybes
- **#3: Respect** — Peer-to-peer energy, not "I'm doing you a favor" vibe
- Most investors chase, guilt-trip, create fake urgency — agents smell it
- Our approach: "I'm an investor who values your expertise. Here's what I can do. What works for you?"
- Result: Agents WANT to send us deals because we make their life easier

### CTA:
"Save this if you're building an off-market pipeline. Or comment which mistake you've made."

**Pillar:** Kingdom Business | **Format:** Talking head + text overlay  
**Goal:** Vulnerability post + faith authenticity

### HOOK (Choose one):
1. "I almost walked away from real estate because I thought success meant losing my soul."
2. "When I hit burnout, I asked God: Can I build wealth and keep my peace?"

### TALKING POINTS (60-90 seconds):
- 43 years old, starting over after years of grinding
- Thought the only path was "hustle harder, sacrifice more, outwork everyone"
- Crashed hard — exhausted, absent from family, distant from God
- Had to rebuild from a Kingdom posture: Obedience over outcomes
- God showed me: Stewardship, not striving. Systems, not hustle.
- Now I wake at 5am for prayer BEFORE the work, not after
- Business grows from peace, not panic

### CTA:
"If you've ever felt this tension, drop a 🙏 below. You're not alone."

### HOOK (Choose one):
1. "Hot take: eXp is the best-kept secret for agents who want passive income."
2. "Most agents will work 30 years and retire broke. Here's the model that changes that."

### TALKING POINTS (60-90 seconds):
- Traditional brokerage: You get commission, they get everything else
- eXp model: Commission + equity + revenue share from your network
- I recruit 10 agents → $8K/year passive PER AGENT = $80K/year while I sleep
- This ISN'T a recruiting pitch — it's an asset-building strategy
- Every agent you help = equity stake in their future success
- Combined with my rental portfolio = true financial freedom
- This is how I went from $80M in sales/nothing → real ownership

### CTA:
"Agents: If this sounds interesting, DM me FREEDOM and I'll send you the breakdown (no pressure)."

**TEXT OVERLAYS:**
- "Traditional: Commission only"
- "eXp: Commission + Equity + Revenue Share"
- "10 agents = $80K/year passive"
- "Asset-building, not recruiting"

## FILMING TIPS

### Energy Level:
- **Not hyped, not monotone** → Conversational confidence
- Imagine explaining this to a friend who's genuinely curious
- Smile when appropriate (especially Kingdom Business posts)
- Serious tone for vulnerability/lesson posts

### Pacing:
- **Don't rush** — You have 60-90 seconds, use it
- Pause between points (makes editing easier)
- Emphasize KEY PHRASES (the text overlays)

### Eye Contact:
- Look directly at camera lens (not at yourself on screen)
- Imagine ONE person on the other side of that lens

### Mistakes:
- If you mess up, PAUSE, then restart that sentence
- Don't restart entire video — fix in editing
- Authentic stumbles are okay (shows you're human)

### Multiple Takes:
- Film hook 2-3 times (pick best energy)
- Film full video 1-2 times (pick best delivery)
- If a take feels OFF, redo it — you'll know

## CAPTION TEMPLATES (Copy-Paste Ready)

### VIDEO 1 (Monday):
```
I sold $80M in real estate and owned nothing. Then God showed me what I was actually building.

For years I was grinding 70-hour weeks, closing big deals, completely burned out. Hit $80M in career sales but had zero assets to show for it.

Then came the moment of clarity: I was building someone else's dream, not mine.

Started praying different prayers: "God, show me how to build with wisdom."

He led me to rentals and revenue share — a stewardship model.

Now: 17 rental units, eXp passive income, time with my family. Same work ethic, completely different direction.

This is Kingdom wealth.

If you're a believer in business, comment AMEN and tell me your biggest win this week. 🙏

### VIDEO 2 (Tuesday):
```
We made $120K from ONE video by doing this differently than every other wholesaler.

Most investors chase homeowners directly — high resistance, low trust.

DTA = Direct-to-Agent model. Peer-to-peer. Relationship-first.

Agents see 100+ deals per year BEFORE they hit the market.

Our posture: Calm, curious, no pressure, serve first.

One viral video → agent reached out → sent us $120K deal.

That proved the model: Serve agents publicly, win deals privately.

Now we're scaling to 200 agent conversations per month.

Tag a real estate agent who should see this. Or DM me SYSTEM if you want the breakdown. 📊

```

### VIDEO 3 (Wednesday):
```
You're sitting on off-market goldmines and selling them all to other investors. Why?

Agents: You see every distressed property, divorce, estate sale, motivated seller.

You list it, market it, negotiate it, close it... then hand the equity to someone else.

I did this for YEARS — $80M in sales, nothing in my pocket but commissions.

What changed: I started asking "Why am I not the buyer?"

Now I keep the best deals, partner on others, build my rental portfolio.

You don't need to quit being an agent — you need to start being an OWNER.

Simple shift: "What if I bought this one?"

If you're an agent tired of watching other people build wealth, DM me EQUITY. 💰

### VIDEO 4 (Thursday):
```
3 things agents look for in an investor (most investors fail all 3):

1️⃣ Speed without pressure — Fast answers, not aggressive follow-ups
2️⃣ Clarity — "Can you close?" "How fast?" No vague maybes
3️⃣ Respect — Peer-to-peer energy, not "I'm doing you a favor"

Most investors chase, guilt-trip, create fake urgency. Agents smell it instantly.

Our approach: "I'm an investor who values your expertise. Here's what I can do. What works for you?"

Result: Agents WANT to send us deals because we make their life easier.

Save this if you're building an off-market pipeline. Or comment which mistake you've made. 👇

I almost walked away from real estate because I thought success meant losing my soul.

43 years old, starting over after years of grinding.

Crashed hard — exhausted, absent from family, distant from God.

### VIDEO 6 (Saturday):
```
Hot take: eXp is the best-kept secret for agents who want passive income.

Traditional brokerage: You get commission, they get everything else.

eXp model: Commission + equity + revenue share from your network.

I recruit 10 agents → $8K/year passive PER AGENT = $80K/year while I sleep.

This ISN'T a recruiting pitch — it's an asset-building strategy.

Every agent you help = equity stake in their future success.

Combined with my rental portfolio = true financial freedom.

This is how I went from $80M in sales/nothing → real ownership.

Agents: If this sounds interesting, DM me FREEDOM and I'll send you the breakdown (no pressure). 🔑
