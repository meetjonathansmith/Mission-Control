## KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working
1. **Instagram Reels are the winner** — 6.83% engagement, 6K+ views, strong saves (77) and shares (42)
2. **Faith + Business content performs best** — "I spent 18 years as a pastor" post hit 19.51% engagement
3. **Audience is growing steadily** — 1.2 followers/day on Instagram, 46% growth in 30 days
4. **DMV audience is present** — Multiple Maryland/Virginia cities in top follower locations (perfect for agent outreach)
5. **Reels have higher reach than posts** — 178 avg reach per reel vs 26 per post

### What's Not Working
1. **Facebook severely underperforming** — Only 166 followers, minimal engagement
2. **Comments are low across both platforms** — 1 comment on 11 IG posts, 9 comments on 27 reels
3. **Reach is still small** — Avg 178 reach per reel means audience is still tiny (but growing)

### Content Pillars Performance (Based on Visible Top Posts)
- **Faith in the Fight:** 19.51% engagement ("I spent 18 years as a pastor")
- **Starting Over at 43:** 8.26% engagement ("If it doesn't scare you...")
- **Documenting the Climb:** Lower engagement on tactical/market intel posts

### Best Posting Times
- **Data not visible in current dashboard view** — Need to navigate to Reports or adjust date range picker to see hourly performance data

### Follower Growth Trend
- **30-day trend:** +36 followers (+46% growth)
- **Velocity increasing:** 1.2 followers/day average
- **Trajectory:** If sustained, would hit ~180 followers by mid-March, ~250 by April

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QUILL

### Double Down On
1. **Faith + Business intersection content** (19.51% engagement proves this is the differentiator)
2. **Personal story Reels** ("Starting over at 43" theme resonates)
3. **Instagram Reels as primary format** (6x better reach than posts)
4. **Carousel posts for deeper storytelling** (best performing post was a carousel)

### Adjust
1. **Reduce or pause Facebook posting** — ROI too low, focus energy on Instagram
2. **Increase comment engagement tactics** — Ask more questions, create more conversation prompts
3. **Test longer Reels** — Top reel had 0:26 avg watch time with 63.7% view rate, audience will stay for substance

### Track Weekly
1. **Engagement rate trend** (is 6.83% sustainable or improving?)
2. **Saves and shares** (77 saves in 30 days is strong — indicates valuable content)
3. **DMV follower %** (track if local agent % is increasing)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **API Integration:** Use `userId=4390162` and `blogId=5663284` to pull data programmatically for Friday Board Meetings
2. **Best Posting Times:** Navigate to Reports section to extract optimal posting schedule
3. **Top 5 All-Time Posts:** Need to expand date range to full account history (not just 30 days)
4. **$120K Deal Attribution:** Begin tracking when content leads to agent outreach (manually log in `memory/content-deal-attribution.md`)
