## RANGE MODEL — THREE SCENARIOS

### CONSERVATIVE (Floor — Based on Worst Months)

**Worst performers:** Nov (response), Feb (ratified), Nov (off-market conversion)

**Per 100,000 texts:**
- Response Rate: 0.77% (Nov low)
- Conversations: 770
- Conv→Off-Market: 17% (Nov/Jan average)
- Off-Markets: **131**
- Offers: 48 (37% of off-markets)
- Ratified: 3 (6% of offers — Feb low)
- Closed: 1 (30% close rate)

**Monthly targets at 100K texts:**
- Off-Markets: **130-140/month**
- Ratified: 3-4/month
- Closed: 1-2/month

---

### REALISTIC (Target — Based on 6-Month Average)

**Average across all months:**

**Per 100,000 texts:**
- Response Rate: 1.26% (6-month average)
- Conversations: 1,260
- Conv→Off-Market: 18% (actual average)
- Off-Markets: **227**
- Offers: 84 (37% of off-markets)
- Ratified: 9 (11% of offers — actual average)
- Closed: 3-4 (40% close rate estimate)

**Monthly targets at 100K texts:**
- Off-Markets: **220-230/month** ✅ Meets 200+ target
- Ratified: 9-10/month
- Closed: 3-4/month

**To hit 10 closed/month at AVERAGE efficiency:**
- Need 250,000-300,000 texts/month
- OR improve close rate from 40% to 70% (9-10 ratifications × 70% = 6-7 closed, still short)
- **Gap: 2.5-3x volume OR significant efficiency gains needed**

---

### STRETCH (Ceiling — Based on Sept/Oct Peak)

**Best 2-month period (Sept + Oct combined):**

**Per 100,000 texts (Sept/Oct efficiency):**
- Response Rate: 1.64% (Sept/Oct average)
- Conversations: 1,640
- Conv→Off-Market: 17% (blended Sept/Oct)
- Off-Markets: **279**
- Offers: 103 (37% of off-markets)
- Ratified: 18 (17% of offers — Sept/Oct blended)
- Closed: 9 (50% close rate)

**Monthly targets at 100K texts:**
- Off-Markets: **270-280/month** ✅ Exceeds 200+ target
- Ratified: 17-18/month
- Closed: 8-9/month

**To hit 10 closed/month at STRETCH efficiency:**
- Need 110,000-120,000 texts/month ✅ Within budget
- This is Sept/Oct performance replicated consistently

## TRENDLINE ANALYSIS

### Response Rate Trend

| Period | Response % | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Sept | 1.49% | Baseline |
| Oct | 1.82% | ↑ Peak (+22%) |
| Nov | 0.77% | ↓ Crash (-58% from Oct) |
| Dec | 1.05% | ↑ Recovery (+36% from Nov) |
| Jan | 1.52% | ↑ Strong recovery (+45% from Dec) |
| Feb | 0.93% | ↓ Decline (-39% from Jan) |

**Trend:** **VOLATILE with degrading peaks**
- Peak performance declining: Oct 1.82% → Jan 1.52% → Feb 0.93%
- November crash likely due to over-sending (95K texts)
- **Diagnosis:** List fatigue + inconsistent send volume

---

### Off-Market Trend

| Month | Off-Markets | Texts | Off-Markets per 100K |
|-------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| Sept | 187 | 59,655 | 314 |
| Oct | 106 | 48,522 | 218 |
| Nov | 125 | 95,537 | 131 |
| Dec | 137 | 108,509 | 126 |
| Jan | 138 | 53,481 | 258 |
| Feb | 107 | 47,868 | 224 |

**Trend:** **DECLINING when normalized for volume**
- Sept: 314 off-markets per 100K texts (best)
- Nov/Dec: 126-131 per 100K (worst)
- Feb: 224 per 100K (recovering)
- **Current Feb pace: ~107/month** (3x shortfall from 200+ target)

**Diagnosis:** Response rate degradation directly impacts off-market volume. Fix response rate = fix off-market volume.

---

### Ratification Trend

| Month | Ratified | Off-Markets | Ratio |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Sept | 11 | 187 | 17:1 ✅ |
| Oct | 8 | 106 | 13:1 ✅ |
| Nov | 5 | 125 | 25:1 ✅ |
| Dec | 6 | 137 | 23:1 ✅ |
| Jan | 4 | 138 | 35:1 ⚠️ |
| Feb | 2 | 107 | 54:1 ❌ |

**Trend:** **DEGRADING offer-to-ratified efficiency**
- Sept/Oct: 13-17:1 (excellent, within industry standard)
- Nov/Dec: 23-25:1 (acceptable, within industry standard)
- Jan: 35:1 (above 30:1 threshold — potential issue)
- Feb: 54:1 (significantly above threshold — BROKEN)

**Diagnosis:** 
- Sept-Dec: Filtering working correctly (18-24:1 range)
- Jan-Feb: Either offer quality degraded OR market conditions changed
- **This DOES warrant investigation** (exceeds 30:1 consistently for 2 months)

## GAP ANALYSIS

### Current State (Feb 2026 Pace)

- Texts: ~48K/month
- Off-Markets: ~107/month
- Ratified: ~2/month (4 projected full month)
- Closed: 4/month

### Gap to REALISTIC (Average) Performance

| Metric | Current | Realistic Target | Gap | % Increase Needed |
|--------|---------|------------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Texts** | 48K | 100K | +52K | +108% |
| **Off-Markets** | 107 | 227 | +120 | +112% |
| **Ratified** | 4 | 9 | +5 | +125% |
| **Closed** | 4 | 4 | 0 | — |

**Primary Gap:** Need to 2x text volume AND improve response rate to hit average performance.

### Gap to STRETCH (Sept/Oct) Performance

| Metric | Current | Stretch Target | Gap | % Increase Needed |
|--------|---------|----------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Texts** | 48K | 110K | +62K | +129% |
| **Off-Markets** | 107 | 279 | +172 | +161% |
| **Ratified** | 4 | 18 | +14 | +350% |
| **Closed** | 4 | 9 | +5 | +125% |

**Primary Gap:** Need to 2.3x text volume AND restore Sept/Oct efficiency.

## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Current Performance vs Targets

**Current (Feb pace):**
- Off-Markets: 107/month
- **Gap to 200/month target: 93 off-markets (87% shortfall)**

**To reach 200 off-markets/month:**
- **Option A:** Double text volume (48K → 96K) at current efficiency → 214 off-markets ✅
- **Option B:** Restore Jan response rate (1.52%) + 25% more volume → 206 off-markets ✅
- **Option C:** Hit Sept efficiency (1.64% response, 17% conv→off) at 70K texts → 195 off-markets ✅

### 2. Volume vs Efficiency Tradeoff

**Sept:** Low volume (60K texts) + high efficiency (1.49% response, 21% conv→off) = 187 off-markets
**Nov:** High volume (95K texts) + low efficiency (0.77% response, 17% conv→off) = 125 off-markets

**Lesson:** Efficiency matters more than volume up to a point. Optimal = 80-100K texts/month with 1.4%+ response.

### 3. Offer-to-Ratified Watchpoint

**Jonathan's rule:** Don't diagnose as broken unless >30:1 consistently.

**Status:**
- Sept-Dec: 13-25:1 ✅ Working correctly
- Jan: 35:1 ⚠️ Above threshold
- Feb: 54:1 ❌ Significantly broken

**Alfred's assessment:** While volume is the primary constraint, Jan-Feb ratification efficiency DOES warrant investigation. Something changed between Dec (23:1) and Jan (35:1). Possible causes:
1. Offer quality degraded (sending weaker offers)
2. Market conditions shifted (more competition for deals)
3. Buyer capacity tightened (fewer buyers closing)
4. Agent relationship quality declined (trust issues)

**Recommendation:** Investigate Jan-Feb offer quality separately from volume scaling efforts. This may be hurting closed deal rate even if we hit 200+ off-markets/month.

## MONTHLY TRAJECTORY FORECAST

### If Current Trend Continues (No Changes)

| Month | Texts | Off-Markets | Ratified | Closed |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Mar | 48K | 107 | 2 | 1 |
| Apr | 48K | 102 | 2 | 1 |
| May | 48K | 97 | 1 | 1 |

**Outcome:** Continued decline. Unsustainable.

---

### If REALISTIC Target Hit (Average Performance Restored)

| Month | Texts | Off-Markets | Ratified | Closed |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Mar | 70K | 159 | 6 | 2-3 |
| Apr | 85K | 193 | 7 | 3 |
| May | 100K | 227 | 9 | 4 |

**Outcome:** Gradual improvement. Still short of 10 deals/month by May.

---

### If STRETCH Target Hit (Sept/Oct Efficiency Restored)

| Month | Texts | Off-Markets | Ratified | Closed |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Mar | 80K | 223 | 13 | 6-7 |
| Apr | 100K | 279 | 16 | 8 |
| May | 110K | 307 | 18 | 9 |

**Outcome:** Rapid recovery. Hit 10 deals/month by June.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Volume (Get to 200 Off-Markets/Month)

**Immediate actions:**
1. Scale texts from 48K → 80K/month (67% increase)
2. Restore response rate to 1.4%+ (message refresh, list rotation, rest periods)
3. Maintain 18-24% conv→off-market rate (DPV nurture working)

**Target:** 200+ off-markets/month by April

---

### Priority 2: Investigate Jan-Feb Ratification Drop

**Jonathan's filter applies:** Off-market-to-deal ratio (18-24:1) is standard. Don't obsess over this.

**BUT:** Jan-Feb ratification is >30:1 for 2 consecutive months. This warrants investigation even under Jonathan's rule.

**Recommended actions:**
1. Pull Jan-Feb offers (41 total)
2. Identify why ratification rate dropped from 23:1 (Dec) to 54:1 (Feb)
3. Check: Offer quality? Buyer availability? Market competition?
4. If offer quality issue: Tighten criteria
5. If buyer issue: Expand buyer bench
6. If market issue: May need to adjust pricing or deal selection

**Target:** Restore ratification to 20-25:1 by March

## FINAL ANSWER

**Trendline:** **DECLINING overall, with brief recoveries**
- Response rate peaked in Oct (1.82%), now at Feb low (0.93%)
- Off-market volume declining when normalized for send volume
- Ratification efficiency collapsed in Jan-Feb (35:1 → 54:1)

**Gap to close FIRST:** Current (107 off-markets/month) → REALISTIC AVERAGE (227 off-markets/month)
- Need 2.1x improvement
- Achievable by: 2x volume + restore 1.4% response rate

**Sept/Oct is aspirational, not immediate target.** Focus on hitting 6-month average performance first (227 off-markets/month), then stretch toward Sept/Oct peak (279/month).

**Current → Average = 120 more off-markets/month**  
**Average → Stretch = 52 more off-markets/month**

Close the first gap (2x harder) before chasing the second.
