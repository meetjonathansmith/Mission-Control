## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Quill's Content Strategy

**Facebook Personal** is where you already have an **established audience (2.1K followers)** and **higher engagement on best posts** (17% on top post vs Instagram's 19.51% but on smaller reach).

**Instagram** is where you have **momentum and growth** (+46% in 30 days).

### Recommended Approach
1. **Post to both platforms** — Repurpose content across both
2. **Prioritize Instagram for growth** — Faster follower acquisition
3. **Use Facebook for depth** — Leverage existing 2.1K audience for deeper engagement
4. **Double down on Faith + Career story content** — Works on both platforms (Feb 10 post performed well on both)

### Content Optimization
- **More personal story posts** — The "I spent 18 years as a pastor" format crushes on Facebook
- **Improve shareability** — Only 3 shares in 28 days is extremely low
- **Increase comment prompts** — 29 comments from 2.1K followers is low engagement
- **Cross-promote** — Use Facebook's larger audience to drive Instagram growth
