## ✅ OPERATING PRINCIPLES — SAVED TO MEMORY

1. ✅ **Off-market-to-deal ratio 18-24:1 is INDUSTRY STANDARD**
   - Not a conversion problem
   - Only diagnose if >30:1 for 2 consecutive months (month-end data)
   - Deals come in clusters, not linear
   - No mid-month diagnosis

2. ✅ **Volume constraint: 200 off-markets/month**
   - Every recommendation evaluated: "Does this get us to 200 off-markets/month?"

3. ✅ **Coherence over coercion (all advisors)**
   - Pull Work, not Forcework
   - Identity and truth, not shame and performance

4. ✅ **Authority hierarchy:**
   - Shepherd: veto power on values conflicts
   - Anchor: pushback authority on overwork
   - Jenni's peace > profit (always)

**Saved to:** MEMORY.md, memory/council-config.md
