## Key Trends

### Response Rate Volatility
**January range:** 1.06% - 2.38% (avg 1.52%)  
**February so far:** 0.78% - 1.27% (avg 0.93%)

**Observation:** Response rates are declining month-over-month. Feb is running 39% lower than Jan average.

**Possible causes:**
- Market saturation (agents getting texted more frequently?)
- Seasonal drop (post-holidays, winter slowdown?)
- Message fatigue (same copy getting stale?)
- List quality degradation (scraping older/colder leads?)

### Volume Trends
**January:** 53,481 texts (full month)  
**February:** 47,868 texts (13 days) → projected ~110k for full month

**Observation:** Volume is UP significantly (2x January pace), but response rate is DOWN.

**Question:** Are you intentionally scaling volume? Or is this campaign overlap/acceleration?

### Funnel Efficiency Comparison

**January 2026:**
- Texts → Conversations: 1.52%
- Conversations → Off-Market: 16.9%
- Off-Market → Offers: 21.9%
- Offers → Ratified: 13.3%

**February 2026 (partial):**
- Texts → Conversations: 0.93% ⬇️
- Conversations → Off-Market: 24.0% ⬆️
- Off-Market → Offers: 30.8% ⬆️
- Offers → Ratified: 6.1% ⬇️ (early data, small sample)

**Critical insight:**  
Your BOTTOM funnel is improving (better deal quality, higher offer conversion) but your TOP funnel is degrading (lower response rate).

**Translation:**  
- The agents who DO respond are sending better deals
- But fewer agents are responding overall
- Net effect: Similar deal volume but at higher cost (more texts per deal)

### Deal Outcomes

**January 2026:**
- 4 ratified deals
- 0 closed deals (as of end of month)
- 3 "didn't sell"

**February 2026 (partial):**
- 2 ratified deals (Kayak, Gunther)
- 1 closed deal
- 2 "didn't sell"

**Close rate seems to be improving** - 1 closed in 13 days vs 0 in 31 days (Jan).

**Question:** Did Jan deals close in Feb? Or did they fall through?

## Strategic Implications

### Problem #1: Top-of-Funnel Degradation
Response rate dropped from 1.52% (Jan) to 0.93% (Feb).

**This costs you ~270 lost conversations per month at current volume.**

**Possible fixes:**
1. **Message refresh** - Test new copy, hooks, CTAs
2. **List quality audit** - Are you texting the same agents repeatedly?
3. **Targeting refinement** - Double down on VA Beach model (9.28% response)
4. **Frequency capping** - Are agents getting multiple texts and tuning out?

### Problem #2: Volume vs Quality Tradeoff
You're sending 2x texts in Feb vs Jan, but response rate is down 39%.

**Math:**
- Jan: 53k texts × 1.52% = 806 conversations
- Feb (projected): 110k texts × 0.93% = 1,023 conversations

**You get +27% more conversations but at 2x the cost.**

**Question:** Is this intentional scaling or campaign overlap? If intentional, ROI may be declining.

### Opportunity: Bottom-Funnel Excellence
Off-Market → Offers conversion jumped from 22% to 31%.

**This means your deal quality is BETTER in Feb.**

**Possible reasons:**
- Better agent relationships (repeat senders?)
- Message targeting working (right agents, better properties?)
- Offer process improved (faster response, better terms?)

**Recommendation:** Document what's working in offer conversion and scale it.

### Critical Question: Where Are Jan Deals?
- 4 ratified in Jan
- 0 closed in Jan
- Did they close in Feb? (Only 1 closed showing Feb MTD)

**If Jan deals fell through:** Need to understand why (financing? inspection? cold feet?)  
**If Jan deals are still pending:** What's typical ratification → close timeline?

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Response rate diagnostic**
   - Pull message logs from SC
   - Compare Jan high-performing messages vs Feb messages
   - Test message variations in Feb week 3

2. **List quality audit**
   - How many agents are getting texted 2x, 3x, 4x?
   - Segment: First-time vs repeat contacts
   - Test: Does response rate degrade on repeat contact?

3. **VA Beach deep dive**
   - VA Beach campaign had 9.28% response (vs 0.93% Feb avg)
   - What's different? Message? Targeting? Geography?
   - Replicate to other markets

### This Month (Feb)
4. **Ratified deal tracking**
   - Track Kayak and Gunther from ratification to close
   - Document timeline and any friction points
   - Use this to forecast close rates

5. **"Didn't sell" post-mortem**
   - 2 deals in Feb, 3 in Jan fell through
   - Interview agents or buyers: Why?
   - Refine targeting to avoid similar properties

6. **Volume optimization**
   - You're burning ~110k texts/month at declining response
   - Test: Can you cut volume 30% and focus on high-response segments?
   - Goal: Same conversations at lower cost

### Next Month (March)
7. **Funnel efficiency targets**
   - Goal: Get response rate back to 1.5%+ (Jan levels)
   - Maintain or improve 30% off-market → offer conversion
   - Track ratified → closed rate with more data

8. **Campaign segmentation**
   - High-performers (VA Beach model): Max volume, best message
   - Mid-performers: Test message variations
   - Low-performers: Pause or deprioritize

## Summary Stats: Jan vs Feb 2026

| Metric | Jan 2026 | Feb 2026 (MTD) | Change |
|--------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Texts sent | 53,481 | 47,868 (13d) | +2x pace |
| Response rate | 1.52% | 0.93% | -39% |
| Conversations | 812 | 445 | -21% (pace) |
| Off-market | 137 | 107 | +17% (pace) |
| Conv → Off-market | 16.9% | 24.0% | +42% |
| Offers sent | 30 | 33 | +91% (pace) |
| Off-market → Offer | 21.9% | 30.8% | +41% |
| Ratified | 4 | 2 | -17% (pace) |
| Closed | 0 | 1 | ∞ |

**Verdict:**  
Top-of-funnel is weakening (response rate down).  
Bottom-of-funnel is strengthening (offer conversion up).  
Net result: Similar or slightly better deal volume, but at higher text cost.

**Priority:** Fix top-of-funnel before scaling more volume.
