# Smarter Contact Interview - Complete Answers
## Jonathan Smith - Feb 13, 2026

### SECTION 1: LIST INVENTORY

**1. Total agents in DMV list:**
- MD: 24,000
- NOVA: 27,000
- Richmond/VA Beach: 7,332
- Wilmington NC: 3,428 (piss poor performance for 3 months)
- **Total DMV+NC: 61,760 agents**
- Considering Houston TX: 25k agents (could get 50k if wanted)

**2. List sources:**
- Scraped from MLS via data scraper
- Only 5 months old at oldest
- Pulled once (static lists, not refreshing)

**Agent lifecycle:**
- SC (cold outreach) → agent responds with on/off-market → DPV (nurture system)
- DPV: Touch every 14 days via text or call
- Testing "Docs of Property Ventures" - relational approach ("Will you be buyer's agent?" vs "Got off-market deals?")
- 900 agents via relational approach in 3 months (expect deals at month 5-6)

**3. DPV transition:**
- Once agent sends deal → DPV permanently (off SC list)
- ~4,200 agents moved to DPV so far
- **Remaining SC list: 61,760 - 4,200 = 57,560 active agents**

---

### SECTION 2: CURRENT CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

**4. Active campaigns (3 running):**
- MD: 23,254 agents
- VA (NOVA): 17,543 agents
- Richmond/VA Beach: 7,331 agents

**5. Contact frequency:**
- No formal tracking on SC
- Rotate phone numbers + names (Tom, John, Stan, Jenny, Gracie, Jade) to keep fresh
- VA manages SC responses (Jonathan doesn't track patterns yet - Alfred's job now)
- DPV: Every 14 days contact (automated workflow)
- DPV messages: Market pulse questions + encouraging messages ("Real estate agents have our greatest respect...")

**6. Follow-up sequences:**
- Single text campaign → wait 3 weeks → follow-up 1 → wait 3 weeks → follow-up 2
- **Total: 3 texts over 1.5-2 months**
- Agents continue to get texts until: (1) they opt out, or (2) they send a deal

---

### SECTION 3: MESSAGE & DELIVERY

**7. Message templates:**
- A LOT of variations (rotating heavily)
- **Jonathan needs help auditing for spam content**

**8. Send rate:**
- **MD: 6 texts/min**
- **VA: 3-4 texts/min**
- **VA Beach/Richmond: 3-4 texts/min**
- **Goal: 8,000 texts/day**
- Sept/Oct were best months (Jonathan references "grey box" with ratios from that period)
- Historical: Used to take 10k texts to get a deal (needs updated 5.5-month ratio)

**Delivery performance:**
- SC has been "boss" - no major blocking issues

**9. Sender identity:**
- SC: Rotating numbers (different for each campaign)
- DPV: Same number (consistent)

---

### SECTION 4: PERFORMANCE & CONSTRAINTS

**10. Response rate by market:**
- **MD performs best**
- VA Beach: 9.28% (Hampton Roads area)
- Richmond: Big buyers there, wants more deals, hasn't gotten consistent traction

**11. List exhaustion signals:**
- Assumption-based (not tested yet)
- Would look for: Response rate drop, opt-out spike
- **No defined threshold for "rest this list"** (needs Alfred to establish)

**12. Budget:**
- 100,000 texts/month paid
- No rollover if unused
- Buyer covers $1,800/mo of spend (first right of refusal)
- Another buyer wants same deal for Richmond + NOVA markets
- **Could have $4k/mo marketing fees within 60 days if buyers get good deals**

**13. Buyer capacity:**
- **50+ active buyers** (plus 2 big dispo guys with 5k+ lists each)
- Big dispo guy + relationship with New Western
- Can turn deals no problem
- Stanley (new LM) building buyer list this year
- **Not a constraint**

---

### SECTION 5: DECISION FRAMEWORK

**14. Market expansion:**
- DMV capacity questionable for 13 ratified/month (targeting 10 closed)
- **Goal: 100 deals closed in 2026 (min)**
- Houston TX target: 25k agents available
- Model is "essentially a franchise": Build buyer list first, then hit agents and wholesale deals
- Would run DMV + new market simultaneously

**15. Deal source mix:**
- **80% of 2025 deals (38 total) came from SC**
- 20% from referrals/warm sources
- No direct marketing - all DTA (Direct-to-Agent)
- Growing referral deals from social media brand (115 followers produced $120k profit flip - "Wild that it works")
- **Need better attribution tracking (Alfred's job)**

**16. Team capacity:**
- Jonathan manages SC campaigns (launches, monitors, adjusts)
- VA handles all SC responses
- Could have VA execute campaign calendar if Alfred builds it

---

### SECTION 6: GOALS & PRIORITIES

**17. 10 deals/month target:**
- **10 closed/month = 13 ratified/month** (assuming ⅓ fall through)
- Timeline: As fast as possible without breaking the bank
- Acceptable to scale slower if protects list quality
- **Near-term acceptable: 5-6 closed/month now, scale to 10/month by May-June**

**18. Trade-offs:**
- Prefers: **Option B (Slower, sustainable, long-term)**
- Family burn rate: $15k/month
- Debt payoff need: $5-8k/month (all debt paid in 3 months at this rate)
- Also doing 6 flips in 2026 (separate from wholesale)

**Long-term vision:**
- Get 6,000 agents into DPV on culture follow-up
- Once they know you can perform, need only 100 agents sending 1 deal/year each
- "Like a subscription model" - no more top-of-funnel needed once relationship base is built
- **Goal: Faithfully steward relationships, not constantly cold prospect**

## Key Strategic Insights

### Jonathan's Priorities (Ranked)
1. **Sustainable growth** (protect list quality, long-term relationships)
2. **Attribution tracking** (where deals actually come from)
3. **Message spam audit** (concerned about carrier blocks)
4. **Campaign structure optimization** (when to start/stop/rest lists)
5. **Market expansion decision** (Houston vs scale DMV)

### Critical Numbers
- **Available SC list: 57,560 agents** (61,760 - 4,200 in DPV)
- **Current send rate: ~8k texts/day** (goal pace)
- **Contact cadence: 3 texts over 6-8 weeks**
- **Target: 13 ratified/month → 10 closed/month**
- **Budget: 100k texts/month** ($1,800-4,000 covered by buyers)
- **Historical conversion: 10k texts per deal** (Sept/Oct 2025)

### The Endgame Model
- 6,000 agents in DPV (culture nurture system)
- 100 agents × 1 deal/year = 100 deals/year baseline
- At that point: No more cold prospecting, just relationship stewardship
- DTA model scales via relationships, not volume

## Alfred's Deliverables (Based on Interview)

**Immediate:**
1. Message template spam audit
2. 5.5-month conversion ratio analysis (texts per deal, ratified per 10k, etc.)
3. DMV capacity model (can 57k agents support 13 ratified/month sustainably?)
4. Campaign calendar (when to launch, follow-up, rest)
5. List rotation schedule (prevent burnout)
6. Market expansion decision framework (Houston vs scale DMV)

**Ongoing:**
1. Daily KPI tracking (enforce discipline)
2. Deal attribution system (where did each deal come from?)
3. Response pattern analysis (MD vs VA vs Richmond, number rotation impact)
4. List exhaustion monitoring (define thresholds, flag early warnings)
5. Send rate optimization (find sweet spot for each market)
