# PLAN: 200 OFF-MARKETS/MONTH — VOLUME-ONLY STRATEGY

**Built:** Feb 14, 2026, 11:09 AM EST  
**Context:** 13:1 conversion ratio (ELITE, beating 18-24:1 industry standard)  
**Conclusion:** Conversion works. Volume is the ONLY constraint.

---

## THE MATH

**Current state (February):**
- 67 off-markets/month
- 5 ratified (13:1 ratio) ✅ ELITE
- 3 closed + 2 verbals = 5 total
- **Conversion: 7.5% (67 → 5)** vs industry 4-5%

**Target state (200 off-markets/month):**
- 200 off-markets/month
- 15 ratified (13:1 ratio maintained)
- 10-11 closed (70% close rate)
- **Revenue: $125-137K/month** ✅ Exceeds $100K target

**Gap to close:** 67 → 200 off-markets = **+133 off-markets (+199% increase)**

---

## CURRENT FUNNEL (Feb Efficiency)

**Per 100,000 texts:**
- Response rate: 0.93%
- Conversations: 930
- Conv→off-market: 24% (improved from 18% average)
- Off-markets: **223**

**Current Feb pace:**
- ~48K texts → 107 off-markets/month
- Normalized: 223 off-markets per 100K texts

**To hit 200 off-markets/month at current efficiency:**
- 200 / 223 × 100,000 = **90,000 texts/month** ✅

**That's it. 90K texts/month gets us there.**

---

## THREE PATHS TO 200 OFF-MARKETS/MONTH

### PATH A: Volume Only (Easiest)

**Strategy:** Scale texts to 90K/month at current efficiency (0.93% response, 24% conv→off)

**Timeline:** 4 weeks

**Week 1:** 60K texts (+25% from current 48K)
- Expected: 134 off-markets

**Week 2:** 70K texts
- Expected: 156 off-markets

**Week 3:** 80K texts
- Expected: 178 off-markets

**Week 4:** 90K texts
- Expected: **201 off-markets** ✅ TARGET HIT

**Pros:**
- No dependency on response rate recovery
- No new campaigns needed
- Just turn up the volume knob

**Cons:**
- Burns $1,350/month in texts (vs $720 current)
- May accelerate list fatigue
- 90K is near budget ceiling

**Risk level:** LOW  
**Time to target:** 4 weeks

---

### PATH B: Volume + Efficiency (Optimal)

**Strategy:** Scale to 70K texts/month WHILE restoring response rate to 1.4%

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks

**Month 1 (Weeks 1-4): Message Refresh + Volume**
- Deploy 20 fresh message variants (Appendix C)
- Rest MD market (4 weeks)
- Scale NOVA to 6 texts/min (from 4/min)
- Target: 60K texts at 1.1% response (degradation slows)
- Expected: 145 off-markets

**Month 2 (Weeks 5-8): Response Recovery + Scale**
- Bring MD back with fresh messaging
- Response rate recovers to 1.4%
- Scale to 70K texts
- Expected: **219 off-markets** ✅ TARGET EXCEEDED

**At 1.4% response × 70K texts:**
- 980 conversations
- 24% conv→off = 235 off-markets
- Actual conservative: 219 (accounting for variance)

**Pros:**
- Lower text volume (70K vs 90K) = lower cost ($1,050 vs $1,350)
- Sustainable (list fatigue addressed)
- Headroom for future scale (30K texts available before budget ceiling)

**Cons:**
- Takes 2 months vs 1 month
- Depends on response rate recovery (not guaranteed)

**Risk level:** MEDIUM  
**Time to target:** 6-8 weeks

---

### PATH C: Aggressive Volume (Fastest)

**Strategy:** Go straight to 100K texts/month, maximize budget

**Timeline:** 2 weeks

**Week 1:** 75K texts
- Expected: 167 off-markets

**Week 2:** 100K texts
- Expected: **223 off-markets** ✅ TARGET EXCEEDED

**Pros:**
- Fastest path to target (2 weeks)
- Maximum output

**Cons:**
- Highest cost ($1,500/month)
- Highest risk of list exhaustion
- No buffer if response rate crashes
- May overwhelm VA/LM capacity

**Risk level:** HIGH  
**Time to target:** 2 weeks

---

## RECOMMENDED PATH: **PATH B (Volume + Efficiency)**

**Why:**
1. **Sustainable:** Addresses list fatigue while scaling
2. **Cost-effective:** $1,050/month vs $1,350 (Path A) or $1,500 (Path C)
3. **Headroom:** Leaves 30K texts in reserve for emergencies
4. **Team capacity:** 70K is manageable for VA/LM without strain
5. **Proven model:** Sept/Oct did 1.64% response at 108K texts over 2 months (54K/month avg)

**Target:** 219 off-markets/month by mid-April (8 weeks)

**At 13:1 conversion:**
- 219 / 13 = **17 ratified/month**
- At 70% close rate = **12 closed/month** 🚀
- Revenue: **$150K/month** (exceeds target by 50%)

---

## EXECUTION PLAN (PATH B)

### WEEK 1 (Feb 17-23): Foundation

**Actions:**
1. ✅ Deploy 20 message variants (Manual Appendix C) to VA
2. ✅ Rest MD market (22,270 agents take 4-week break)
3. ✅ Scale NOVA send rate: 4 texts/min → 6 texts/min
4. ✅ Launch RVA campaign with fresh variant (V7 or V8)
5. ✅ Train VA on campaign naming convention (30 min)

**Volume target:** 15,000 texts/week (60K/month pace)

**Expected output:**
- ~140 responses
- ~34 off-markets/week
- **136 off-markets/month** (2x current)

---

### WEEK 2-4 (Feb 24 - Mar 16): Stabilize

**Actions:**
1. Monitor response rate (should stabilize at 1.0-1.2%)
2. VA logs all campaigns with naming convention
3. Deploy next message variants (rotate weekly)
4. Continue NOVA + RVA volume
5. Evaluate: Is 60K sustainable for 4 weeks?

**Volume target:** 15,000 texts/week (sustained)

**Expected output:**
- ~34 off-markets/week
- **136 off-markets/month**

**Decision point (Week 4):**
- If response rate ≥1.0%: Proceed to Month 2 scale
- If response rate <1.0%: Extend rest period, don't scale yet

---

### WEEK 5-6 (Mar 17-30): MD Relaunch

**Actions:**
1. ✅ Bring MD back online (22,270 agents, fresh messaging after 4-week rest)
2. ✅ Launch MD with variant V12 or V13 (different from pre-rest)
3. ✅ Maintain NOVA + RVA at current pace
4. ✅ All 3 markets now active

**Volume target:** 17,500 texts/week (70K/month pace)

**Expected output:**
- MD: 6 texts/min × 60 min × 8 hr × 5 days = 14,400 texts/week
- NOVA: 6 texts/min × 60 × 8 × 5 = 14,400 texts/week
- RVA: 5 texts/min × 60 × 8 × 2 days = 4,800 texts/week
- **Total: 33,600 texts/week**

Wait, that's 134K/month if sustained. Let me recalculate for 70K/month target:

**Adjusted:**
- Run campaigns 3-4 days/week instead of 5
- Or reduce hours/day
- Target: 17,500 texts/week = 70K/month

**Expected output (Week 5-6):**
- Response rate: 1.2-1.4% (fresh MD + rested list)
- ~210-245 responses/week
- ~50-59 off-markets/week
- **200-236 off-markets/month** ✅ TARGET HIT

---

### WEEK 7-8 (Apr 1-14): Optimize

**Actions:**
1. Monitor KPIs (response rate, off-markets, ratifications)
2. Track ratification rate (should stay 13-15:1 with elite conversion)
3. Adjust send rates if needed
4. Celebrate hitting 200+ off-markets/month

**Volume target:** 17,500 texts/week (70K/month sustained)

**Expected output:**
- **219 off-markets/month** (average)
- **17 ratified/month** (13:1 ratio)
- **12 closed/month** (70% close rate)

---

## CAPACITY VALIDATION

### VA Capacity (Response Management)

**Current:** ~20 responses/day (based on 48K texts, 0.93% response)

**At 70K texts, 1.4% response:**
- 70,000 × 1.4% = 980 responses/month
- 980 / 22 working days = **45 responses/day**

**VA workload:**
- 45 responses × 3 min/response = 135 min/day = **2.25 hours/day**
- VA capacity: 8 hours/day
- **Utilization: 28%** ✅ Well within limits

**Verdict:** VA can handle 70K/month easily.

---

### LM Capacity (Disposition)

**Current:** ~20 off-markets/week

**At 219 off-markets/month:**
- 219 / 4.3 weeks = **51 off-markets/week**

**LM workload:**
- 51 properties / 5 working days = **10 properties/day**
- At 30 min/property review = 5 hours/day
- At 20 min/property (trained efficiency) = 3.3 hours/day

**LM capacity:** 8 hours/day  
**Utilization (30 min/property):** 63% ✅  
**Utilization (20 min/property):** 41% ✅

**Verdict:** LM can handle 200+ off-markets/month if trained on 20-minute reviews (Manual Appendix G).

**Contingency:** If LM falls behind at 40+ off-markets/week, hire second LM.

---

## BUDGET

**Current spend:** $720/month (48K texts × $0.015)

**Path B spend:** $1,050/month (70K texts × $0.015)

**Increase:** +$330/month

**Buyer fee coverage:** $1,800-4,000/month

**Buffer after text spend:** $750-2,950/month ✅

**ROI at 12 closed deals/month:**
- Text cost: $1,050
- Revenue: $150,000 (12 × $12.5K)
- **ROI: 143x** 🚀

---

## RISK MITIGATION

**Risk 1: Response rate doesn't recover to 1.4%**

**Mitigation:** If response rate stays at 0.93% after MD rest period, scale to 90K texts instead of 70K (Path A fallback).

90K texts × 0.93% × 24% conv→off = 201 off-markets ✅

**Risk 2: List fatigue accelerates**

**Mitigation:** Monitor weekly response rate (Manual Appendix B: KPI Scorecard). If drops below 0.8%, pause and implement 6-week rest.

**Risk 3: VA/LM overwhelmed**

**Mitigation:** Test at 60K texts for 4 weeks before scaling to 70K. If strain appears, hire second VA or LM before proceeding.

**Risk 4: Budget overrun**

**Mitigation:** Buyer fees cover texts ($1,800-4,000 > $1,050). If buyer fees drop below $1,500/month, reduce text volume to 50K until resolved.

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**With 13:1 conversion (ELITE), every off-market counts.**

**200 off-markets/month = 15 ratified = 10-11 closed = $125-137K/month.**

**Path B gets us there in 8 weeks, sustainably, at $1,050/month.**

**This is the ONLY priority.**

**Execute.**
