### Critical Questions

1. **"Agents into world" metric:**
   - What does this mean? Agents added to GHL?
   - 203 agents MTD vs 107 off-market properties
   - Not 1:1 ratio - some agents send multiple properties?

2. **Deals that didn't sell:**
   - 2 deals listed - what happened?
   - Fell through? Waiting period? Buyer backed out?

3. **Ratified vs Closed timing:**
   - 2 ratified in week 1, 1 closed
   - What's typical ratification → close timeline?

4. **Week 2 response rate spike:**
   - 1.27% vs 0.78% in week 1
   - What changed? New campaign? Message variation?
   - Can we sustain this into week 3?

### Recommendations

**#1 Investigate Week 2 Response Rate Improvement**
- Something changed between week 1 and week 2
- Response rate jumped 63% (0.78% → 1.27%)
- Figure out what's working and replicate it

**#2 Track Ratified → Closed Timeline**
- 2 ratified deals from week 1 (Kayak, Gunther)
- Only 1 closed so far
- Need to understand typical close timeline for projections

**#3 Scale What's Working**
- Off-market → Offers conversion at 31% is strong
- This suggests deal quality is good
- Can you increase text volume while maintaining quality?

**#4 Document "Didn't Sell" Reasons**
- 2 deals marked as "didn't sell"
- Understanding failure modes helps refine targeting
- Are these buyer issues, property issues, or timing issues?

### February Projections (Based on Current Pace)

**If current week 2 pace continues:**
- ~120,000 texts for February
- ~1,200 conversations (at 1% response)
- ~300 off-market properties (at 25% conversation→off-market)
- ~90 offers sent (at 30% off-market→offer)
- ~9 deals ratified (at 10% offer→ratified)

**Conservative estimate:** 6-10 deals closed in February 2026
