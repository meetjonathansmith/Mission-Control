# COUNCIL DIGEST — SC Campaign Performance Analysis
**Date:** Saturday, February 14, 2026  
**Topic:** Range Model Review + Path to 200 Off-Markets/Month  
**Council Convened:** 8 advisors

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Question:** How do we reach 200 off-markets/month given current performance of 107/month?

**Consensus:** Volume + efficiency restoration. Scale texts to 80-100K/month while restoring 1.4%+ response rate.

**Dissent:** CMO wants aggressive volume scaling now. CFO urges caution on burn rate. COO flags operational capacity constraints.

**Recommended Path:** Staged scale (48K → 70K → 85K → 100K over 90 days) with response rate recovery in parallel.

## ADVISOR PERSPECTIVES

### 1. CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER (Acquisition & Growth)

**Analysis:**

The volume gap is stark. 107 off-markets/month vs 200 target = 87% shortfall. This isn't a conversion problem—it's a top-of-funnel problem.

**Historical context:**
- Sept/Oct delivered 279 off-markets per 100K texts
- Current Feb pace: 224 per 100K texts (20% degradation)
- Response rate collapsed from 1.82% (Oct) to 0.93% (Feb)

**Root causes:**
1. List fatigue (8 months of contact, no formal rest strategy)
2. Message staleness (agents seeing similar variants repeatedly)
3. Inconsistent send volume (48K → 95K → 48K creates whiplash)

**Recommendations:**

**Immediate (Week 1-2):**
- Deploy 20 fresh message variants (Appendix C in manual)
- Implement list rotation: Rest MD for 4 weeks (just completed FU2)
- Scale NOVA to 6 texts/min (currently 4/min) to compensate
- Target: 60K texts in March

**Short-term (Month 2):**
- Bring MD back online with fresh messaging
- Scale to 80K texts/month across all markets
- Test NC revival (500-agent batch with new message)
- Target: 160-180 off-markets/month

**90-Day (Month 3):**
- Scale to 100K texts/month (full budget utilization)
- Add 4th touch to cycle if response rate sustains >1.4%
- Target: 220-240 off-markets/month ✅

**Risk:** Pushing volume too fast without rest periods could accelerate list exhaustion. Balance volume with sustainability.

**Conviction:** HIGH. This is a solved problem—we've done it before (Sept/Oct). Just need to replicate proven playbook.

### 2. CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (Budget & ROI)

**Analysis:**

Current spend rate supports aggressive scaling, but margin protection requires discipline.

**Financial snapshot:**
- Text budget: $1,800-4,000/month covered by buyer fees
- Current burn: ~$720/month (48K texts × $0.015)
- Available headroom: $1,080-3,280/month
- **Runway for 100K texts/month:** $1,500/month = within budget ✅

**Cost per off-market:**
- Current: $720 / 107 = **$6.73 per off-market**
- At 200/month: $1,500 / 200 = **$7.50 per off-market** (acceptable)
- At Sept efficiency: $1,500 / 279 = **$5.38 per off-market** (excellent)

**Cost per closed deal:**
- Current: ~$180 per closed deal (4 deals/month)
- Industry benchmark: $1,200-3,000
- **Status: Well below industry standard** ✅

**ROI analysis:**

At 100K texts/month:
- Cost: $1,500
- Expected deals (realistic model): 3-4/month
- Revenue (at $12.5K avg): $37,500-50,000
- **ROI: 25-33x** 🔥

At Sept efficiency:
- Cost: $1,500
- Expected deals: 9/month
- Revenue: $112,500
- **ROI: 75x** 🚀

**Risks:**

1. **Buyer fee dependency:** $1,800-4,000/month comes from buyer fees. If deals slow, text budget tightens.
2. **Volume scaling without conversion gains:** If we scale to 100K texts but stay at current efficiency (107 → 214 off-markets), we get 214 off-markets but only 4-5 closed deals. Still short of 10/month target.
3. **API spend:** Current $45.66/month ($200 budget). Alfred's analysis work increases token usage. Monitor for cost creep.

**Recommendations:**

1. ✅ **Approve volume scale to 100K texts/month** (ROI justified)
2. ⚠️ **Require 1.4%+ response rate before scaling beyond 80K** (protect efficiency)
3. ⚠️ **Track buyer fee collection rate** (ensure cash flow covers text spend)
4. ✅ **Maintain 70%+ margin standard on all deals** (no margin sacrifice for volume)

**Conviction:** MEDIUM-HIGH. Numbers support scaling, but require discipline on efficiency thresholds.

---

### 3. CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER (Execution & Systems)

**Analysis:**

CMO wants 100K texts/month. Can VA + LM handle the operational load?

**Current capacity:**
- VA: Managing ~100 responses/day comfortably (2-3 min per response = 5 hours/day)
- LM: Processing ~20 off-market submissions/week (48 hours turnaround on average)

**Projected load at 100K texts/month:**

At 1.4% response rate:
- 1,400 responses/month = **47 responses/day**
- VA capacity: 100/day ✅ (well within limits)

At 18% conv→off-market:
- 252 off-markets/month = **~60/week**
- LM capacity: Currently handling 20/week, would need to handle 60/week
- **Gap: 3x increase in LM workload** ⚠️

**Bottleneck identified: LM disposition speed**

Current process:
1. Agent sends off-market → VA logs it → LM reviews within 48 hours → Offer or pass decision

At 60 off-markets/week:
- LM needs to review 12 properties/day (currently ~4/day)
- **3x increase in daily workload**

**Is this feasible?**

If LM spends 30 min per property review (comps, ARV, deal analysis):
- 12 properties × 30 min = **6 hours/day** on disposition alone
- Current: ~2 hours/day
- **Gap: +4 hours/day** (need to reduce review time to 20 min/property OR hire second LM)

**Operational risks:**

1. **Response time degradation:** If VA gets overwhelmed (unlikely) or LM falls behind (likely), agents get slow responses. Damages relationships.
2. **Quality vs speed tradeoff:** Rushing disposition to handle volume = more weak offers = lower ratification rate (already at 54:1, don't make it worse).
3. **Campaign coordination:** More volume = more campaigns running simultaneously = more complexity for VA to track attribution.

**Recommendations:**

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ **Implement campaign naming convention** (Appendix A in manual) — VA needs this before scaling
2. ✅ **Set up List Health Dashboard** (Appendix B) — Early warning system for volume issues
3. ⚠️ **Train LM on 20-minute disposition protocol** — Reduce review time per property without sacrificing quality

**Before scaling to 100K:**
1. ⚠️ **Test 70K texts/month for 2 weeks** — Validate VA + LM can handle 40% load increase
2. ⚠️ **Pre-qualify LM capacity at 40 off-markets/week** — If bottleneck appears, pause scale until fixed
3. ⚠️ **Consider hiring second LM or VA** — If 70K test shows strain

**System gaps to fill:**
- Attribution tracking (VA logs campaign IDs) — Manual Appendix A covers this
- Weekly KPI scorecard (VA pre-fills) — Manual Appendix B covers this
- DPV migration speed (agents moving to nurture within 24 hours) — Currently slow, needs tightening

**Conviction:** MEDIUM. Operationally feasible with training + process tightening, but LM capacity is a real constraint at 200+ off-markets/month.

---

### 4. CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER (Pipeline & Close Rate)

**Analysis:**

Everyone's focused on off-market volume (correct), but let's talk about what happens AFTER we get 200 off-markets/month.

**Current math:**
- 107 off-markets/month
- 18-24:1 industry standard ratio = 4.5-6 closed deals expected
- Actual: 4 closed deals/month ✅ (within expected range)

**At 200 off-markets/month:**
- 18-24:1 ratio = **8-11 closed deals/month expected**
- Target: 10 closed/month ✅
- **Volume alone gets us there** (assuming industry-standard filtering)

**But here's the problem:**

Jan-Feb ratification efficiency:
- Jan: 35:1 (138 off-markets → 4 ratified)
- Feb: 54:1 (107 off-markets → 2 ratified)

At Feb efficiency (54:1) with 200 off-markets:
- 200 / 54 = **3.7 closed deals/month** ❌ (still short of 10)

**Two futures:**

**Future A (Industry Standard Maintained):**
- 200 off-markets/month × 18-24:1 ratio = 8-11 deals ✅

**Future B (Feb Efficiency Persists):**
- 200 off-markets/month × 54:1 ratio = 3.7 deals ❌

**Which future are we heading toward?**

Jonathan's rule: "Don't diagnose offer-to-ratified as broken unless >30:1 consistently."

Status: 
- Dec: 23:1 ✅
- Jan: 35:1 ⚠️ (above threshold)
- Feb: 54:1 ❌ (significantly above threshold)

**This IS "consistent" now (2 months).** Something broke between Dec and Jan.

**Possible causes:**

1. **Offer quality degraded** — LM sending weaker offers due to volume pressure or changed criteria
2. **Buyer capacity tightened** — Fewer buyers closing deals (POF issues, market conditions)
3. **Market competition increased** — More wholesalers competing for same deals
4. **Agent relationships weakened** — Trust erosion from over-contact or poor experiences

**Recommendations:**

**Diagnostic (Week 1):**
1. Pull all Jan-Feb offers (41 total)
2. Compare to Dec offers (60 total) — What's different? Price? Property type? Location?
3. Interview LM: "What changed in your offer criteria between Dec and Jan?"
4. Check buyer activity: How many active buyers in Feb vs Dec? Any drop-offs?

**If offer quality issue:**
- Tighten criteria (back to Sept selectivity model)
- Pre-match buyers BEFORE offering (no spray-and-pray)
- 48-hour max turnaround on offers (speed wins)

**If buyer capacity issue:**
- Expand buyer bench (need 75-100 active vs current 50+)
- Pre-qualify harder (proof of funds + track record)
- Build backup buyers for every property (primary + secondary)

**If market competition issue:**
- Price more aggressively (accept lower margins temporarily to win deals)
- Speed up disposition (20-minute reviews, not 48-hour delays)
- Build agent loyalty (priority treatment for repeat senders)

**Pipeline reality check:**

Even if we fix volume (200 off-markets/month) and restore ratification (20:1), we still need 70% close rate on ratified deals to hit 10 closed/month.

Current close rate: Unknown (not enough data). Assumed 50-70%.

**If close rate is <50%, we need 13-15 ratifications/month, not 10.** This matters.

**Conviction:** HIGH. Volume is necessary but not sufficient. Ratification efficiency AND close rate both need attention.

### 5. CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (Data & Attribution)

**Analysis:**

We're flying blind. 6 months of data, but attribution is broken.

**What we know:**
- 883 off-markets received (Sept-Feb)
- 36 ratified
- 4 closed

**What we DON'T know:**
- Which campaigns produced those 883 off-markets?
- Which message variants have highest response rates?
- Which markets produce highest-quality off-markets?
- Which agents are repeat senders (vs one-time)?
- What's the time lag from text → response → off-market → ratification → close?

**This isn't academic. It's strategic.**

**Example:** If we knew VA Beach campaign (9.28% response) was producing 3x more off-markets than MD campaigns (4.09% response), we'd shift budget immediately.

**But we don't know.** We're guessing.

**Current state of attribution:**

❌ No campaign tracking (VA doesn't log which campaign an agent came from)  
❌ No message variant tracking (which of 20 variants perform best?)  
❌ No market-level off-market quality tracking (MD vs NOVA vs RVA)  
❌ No agent repeat analysis (how many agents send 2+ deals?)  
❌ No time-to-close tracking (text → ratification lag time)

**The SC Operations Manual has the framework (Section 8: Attribution Tracking).**

**It's just not implemented.**

**What happens when we scale to 200 off-markets/month without attribution?**

1. We won't know which campaigns are working (can't optimize)
2. We won't know which message variants to retire (wasting sends on low performers)
3. We won't know which markets to prioritize (budget allocation guesswork)
4. We won't be able to replicate VA Beach success (no data to identify factors)

**This is like driving blindfolded at 100 mph.**

**Recommendations:**

**Week 1 (Before Scaling):**
1. ✅ **Implement campaign naming convention** (Manual Appendix A)
   - Format: `[MARKET]-2026-W[##]-[TYPE]-V[#]`
   - VA logs every campaign launch with this ID
2. ✅ **VA logs responding agents** (Manual Section 8)
   - Agent name, phone, date, campaign ID
   - Takes 1 minute per responding agent
3. ✅ **Tag off-markets with source campaign** in GHL
   - When agent sends property, VA adds campaign ID to GHL record
   - Enables deal-level attribution

**Week 2-4 (Backfill Historical Data):**
1. Pull all GHL off-market records (Sept-Feb)
2. Cross-reference with SC campaign dates
3. Best-effort attribution: "This off-market came in Nov 15, which campaigns were active then?"
4. Partial data > no data

**Month 2 (Reporting):**
1. Build attribution dashboard: Campaign → Responses → Off-Markets → Deals
2. Identify winners (VA Beach model) and losers (NC campaigns)
3. Retire bottom 20% of campaigns, double down on top 20%

**Long-term (Month 3+):**
1. A/B test message variants (send V1 to 1,000 agents, V2 to 1,000 agents, compare response)
2. Market ROI analysis (cost per off-market by market)
3. Agent lifetime value tracking (how many agents send 2+ deals?)

**Without this, we're optimizing blind.**

**Conviction:** CRITICAL. Attribution is the foundation for all other optimizations.

### 6. CHIEF PEOPLE OFFICER (Team & Training)

**Analysis:**

VA and LM are the human bottleneck. They need training, clarity, and support to execute at scale.

**Current skills:**

**VA (SC Response Manager):**
- ✅ Good: Fast responder, friendly tone, logs data
- ⚠️ Gap: No campaign attribution logging (not trained yet)
- ⚠️ Gap: Slow DPV migration (agents sit 24-48 hours before moving)
- ⚠️ Gap: No proactive list health monitoring (doesn't flag response rate drops)

**LM (Lead Manager / Disposition):**
- ✅ Good: Property analysis, deal evaluation
- ⚠️ Gap: Slow turnaround (48-hour average, need 24 hours)
- ⚠️ Gap: No selectivity framework (what makes a good offer vs weak offer?)
- ⚠️ Gap: Doesn't track ratification rate (doesn't know she's at 54:1)

**If we scale to 100K texts/month without training:**

- VA will drown in 50+ responses/day without attribution system
- LM will send weak offers under time pressure (makes 54:1 worse)
- Jonathan will micromanage both (negates leverage)

**The SC Operations Manual has the training plan (Appendix G: VA Training Checklist).**

**It's just not executed.**

**Recommendations:**

**Week 1: VA Training (4 hours total, spread over 4 days)**

Day 1 (1 hour):
- Campaign naming convention (Section 8)
- Response attribution logging (log every responding agent + campaign ID)
- Test: VA creates 5 sample campaign names correctly

Day 2 (1 hour):
- DPV migration protocol (Section 3)
- When to move agents to DPV (off-market sent = immediate move)
- Test: VA walks through 3 sample scenarios

Day 3 (1 hour):
- List Health Dashboard (Section 9)
- Weekly updates (response rate, delivery rate, opt-outs)
- Test: VA fills sample scorecard with dummy data

Day 4 (1 hour):
- Message variant rotation (Appendix C)
- Never send same message to same agent twice
- Test: VA selects correct variant for next campaign

**Post-training:**
- VA gets one-page cheat sheet (Appendix A: Marching Orders)
- Weekly check-ins (Fridays, 15 minutes) to review KPIs
- Escalation protocol: If response rate drops below threshold, VA alerts Jonathan immediately

**Week 2: LM Training (2 hours)**

Session 1 (1 hour):
- September selectivity model (only top 10-15% of properties)
- Buyer pre-match rule (no offer without confirmed buyer interest)
- 48-hour → 24-hour turnaround goal
- Test: LM reviews 3 sample properties, decides offer/pass with reasoning

Session 2 (1 hour):
- Off-market-to-deal ratio explained (18-24:1 is normal)
- When to worry (>30:1 consistently = investigate)
- Weekly self-review: "How many offers sent? How many ratified? Am I at 20:1?"
- Test: LM calculates her own ratification rate from last month's data

**Post-training:**
- LM gets September offer criteria checklist (pulled from those 22 ratified deals)
- Daily standup (5 minutes): "How many properties reviewed yesterday? Any blockers?"
- Escalation protocol: If ratification rate >30:1 for 2 weeks, LM alerts Jonathan

**Cost of NOT training:**

- VA doesn't log campaigns → no attribution → can't optimize
- LM sends weak offers → ratification stays at 54:1 → volume doesn't translate to deals
- Jonathan spends 2+ hours/day firefighting issues that trained team could handle

**Cost of training:** 6 hours (VA) + 2 hours (LM) = 8 hours total = $200-400 if outsourced, or 1 day of Jonathan's time.

**ROI:** Infinite. One properly trained VA + LM = 10x leverage for Jonathan.

**Conviction:** CRITICAL. Team is the execution engine. Training them = unlocking scale.

### 7. CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER (Long-Term Positioning)

**Analysis:**

Short-term: Get to 200 off-markets/month. Long-term: Build a machine that doesn't need Jonathan's constant attention.

**Strategic questions:**

1. **Is DTA (Direct-to-Agent) the right model long-term?**
   - Current: 80%+ of deals from SC cold outreach
   - Sustainable? Or are we burning through agents?
   - Alternative: Shift to relationship-based (DPV nurture becomes primary, SC becomes secondary)

2. **What's the endgame for DMV markets?**
   - 54,132 agents in rotation
   - After 2-3 years of contact, list will exhaust
   - Then what? Houston? Atlanta? Or shift models entirely?

3. **How do we scale beyond 10 deals/month?**
   - Jonathan's target: $100K/month revenue at 70%+ margins
   - 10 deals/month × $12.5K = $125K/month ✅ (exceeds target)
   - But is 10 deals/month the ceiling? Or just first milestone?

**The 18-24:1 off-market ratio is a FEATURE, not a bug.**

Jonathan's insight: "Most off-markets from agents have retail pricing. We filter for the 4-5% that are real deals. That IS the model working."

**This is correct. And it has implications.**

**Implication 1: DTA is a filtering game, not a conversion game.**

We can't "optimize" our way to 10:1 or 5:1 ratios. The math is the math. Most properties agents send are retail-priced.

Our edge: Speed (24-hour offers), relationships (agents trust us), and buyer bench (we can close).

**Implication 2: Volume is the only scale lever.**

If 18-24:1 is fixed, and we want 10 deals/month, we MUST get 180-240 off-markets/month. There's no shortcut.

**Implication 3: List lifetime value is finite.**

Every agent has a lifetime value (0.13-0.24% chance of producing a deal). After 30 touches over 3 years, they're retired.

DMV has 54,132 agents. At 0.24% conversion (Sept efficiency), that's **130 total deals over 3 years** from this list.

130 deals / 36 months = **3.6 deals/month average** if we exhaust the entire list perfectly.

**We can't get to 10 deals/month from DMV alone long-term.** We need Houston, or we need to shift models.

**Strategic recommendations:**

**Short-term (2026): DTA dominance**
- Scale SC to 100K texts/month
- Get to 200+ off-markets/month
- Hit 10 deals/month by June
- DTA remains 80%+ of revenue

**Mid-term (2027): Hybrid model**
- DTA (SC cold outreach): 50% of deals
- Relationship (DPV nurture): 30% of deals
- Referral/Inbound: 20% of deals
- Houston expansion for fresh list supply

**Long-term (2028+): Relationship dominance**
- DTA (SC cold outreach): 20% of deals (new markets only)
- Relationship (DPV + agent loyalty): 60% of deals
- Referral/Inbound: 20% of deals
- Brand becomes the acquisition engine (agents bring deals to Jonathan, not vice versa)

**The shift:**

Year 1: Chase agents  
Year 2: Nurture agents  
Year 3: Agents chase you  

**Right now, we're in Year 1.** Focus on volume, scale, and efficiency.

But don't lose sight of Year 2 transition. DPV nurture (4,200 agents) should be growing faster than SC cold list (54,132 agents).

**Current DPV growth rate:** Unknown (no tracking). This is a blind spot.

**If DPV is growing 100-200 agents/month, we're on track for hybrid model by 2027.**  
**If DPV is growing <50 agents/month, we're burning through agents faster than we're converting them.** Unsustainable.

**Recommendation:** Track DPV growth rate monthly. Report in weekly KPI scorecard (Appendix B).

**Conviction:** MEDIUM-HIGH. Short-term tactics (scale SC) must align with long-term strategy (build relationship engine). Don't sacrifice Year 3 for Year 1 wins.

---

### 8. CHIEF RISK OFFICER (Downside Protection)

**Analysis:**

Everyone's bullish on scaling. Let me be the voice of caution.

**What could go wrong?**

**Risk 1: List Exhaustion Accelerates**

Current response rate: 0.93% (Feb). Degrading from 1.82% (Oct) peak.

If we scale to 100K texts/month without fixing list fatigue:
- Response rate could drop to 0.5% (Nov worst × 0.65 degradation)
- Off-markets: 100K × 0.5% × 18% = **90 off-markets/month** (worse than current)
- We'd be spending 2x but getting 0.84x results

**Mitigation:** Implement rest periods BEFORE scaling (Manual Section 5). Don't scale until response rate stabilizes at 1.2%+.

**Risk 2: Delivery Rate Collapse**

Current: 96-97% (excellent). But at 100K texts/month, carrier scrutiny increases.

If delivery rate drops to 85% (industry average):
- 15% of texts don't deliver
- Response rate effectively drops 15%
- Off-markets: 227 × 0.85 = **193 off-markets/month** (short of 200 target)

**Mitigation:** Run message spam audit (Manual Section 6) before scaling. Test new message variants on 100-agent batches. Monitor delivery rate weekly.

**Risk 3: VA/LM Capacity Breaks**

COO flagged this: LM currently handles 20 off-markets/week. At 200/month, she'd need to handle 60/week (3x increase).

If LM falls behind:
- Response time degrades (48 hours → 5 days)
- Agents move on to other buyers
- Off-markets don't convert to ratifications
- **200 off-markets/month becomes 100 off-markets/month due to disposition bottleneck**

**Mitigation:** Train LM on 20-minute review protocol (Manual Appendix G). Test at 40 off-markets/week before scaling to 60. Hire second LM if bottleneck confirmed.

**Risk 4: Budget Overrun**

CFO said $1,500/month for 100K texts is within budget ($1,800-4,000 covered by buyer fees).

But buyer fees are VARIABLE. They depend on deals closing.

If deals drop from 4/month to 2/month (because ratification is still broken at 54:1):
- Buyer fee revenue: $1,800-2,000/month (lower end)
- Text spend: $1,500/month
- **Margin squeeze: Only $300-500 buffer**

One bad month (0 deals closed) = negative cash flow on text spend.

**Mitigation:** Collect buyer fees upfront (before deal closes). Build 2-month text budget reserve ($3,000) before scaling to 100K/month.

**Risk 5: Ratification Stays Broken**

Jan-Feb: 35:1 → 54:1 (well above 30:1 threshold).

If this persists at 200 off-markets/month:
- 200 / 54 = **3.7 closed deals/month** (vs 10 target)
- We'd have the volume but not the conversions
- Revenue: $46,250/month (short of $125K target)

**Mitigation:** Investigate Jan-Feb offer quality THIS WEEK (per CRO recommendation). Don't scale volume until ratification is back below 30:1.

**Risk 6: Market Saturation**

What if DMV is saturated? What if 100K texts/month at 1.4% response is the ceiling?

At 1.4% × 100K = 1,400 conversations  
At 18% conv→off = 252 off-markets  
At 24:1 ratio = 10.5 deals  

**This hits target.** But it assumes 1.4% response is achievable at 100K volume.

Oct hit 1.82% at 48K volume. Will 100K volume sustain 1.4%?

**Unknown.** We've never sent 100K texts/month consistently.

**Mitigation:** Scale gradually (48K → 70K → 85K → 100K over 90 days). Monitor response rate at each step. If it drops below 1.2%, pause and rest markets.

**Risk 7: Houston Expansion Premature**

If DMV fails to hit 10 deals/month by June, pressure will mount to expand to Houston.

But Houston has ALL the same risks:
- Unproven buyer bench (0 of 10 required buyers)
- Unknown market dynamics (different property types, pricing)
- No local knowledge (Jonathan doesn't know Houston submarkets)
- Divided attention (VA/LM managing 4 markets instead of 3)

Expanding to Houston before fixing DMV = **2x the problems, 0x the solutions.**

**Mitigation:** Don't even discuss Houston until DMV hits 8+ deals/month for 2 consecutive months. Fix what's broken before adding complexity.

**Conviction:** HIGH. Risks are manageable with staged approach. But rushing scale = disaster.

## COUNCIL VOTE: PATH FORWARD

**Motion:** Scale SC texts from 48K/month → 100K/month over 90 days, targeting 200+ off-markets/month by May.

**CMO:** ✅ FOR (aggressive scale, prioritize volume)  
**CFO:** ✅ FOR (ROI supports it, budget allows)  
**COO:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (train team first, test at 70K before 100K)  
**CRO:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (fix ratification issue first, then scale)  
**CTO:** ✅ FOR (implement attribution, then scale)

5. Monitor response rate weekly (pause if drops below 1.2%)

**If conditions met:** Proceed to 100K/month by May  
**If conditions not met:** Cap at 70K/month until fixed

---

## ALFRED'S SYNTHESIS

**Unanimous agreement:** Volume is the primary constraint. Need 200+ off-markets/month.

**Key tension:** CMO wants aggressive scale NOW. COO/CRO/Risk want staged approach with safeguards.

**Recommended path:** Staged scale (48K → 70K → 85K → 100K over 90 days) with training, attribution, and ratification investigation in parallel.

**Timeline:**

**Week 1 (Feb 17-23):**
- Train VA (4 hours) + LM (2 hours)
- Implement attribution tracking
- Investigate Jan-Feb ratification drop
- Scale to 60K texts (25% increase)

**Week 2-4 (Feb 24 - Mar 16):**
- Test 70K texts/month
- Monitor: Response rate, delivery rate, VA/LM capacity
- If successful: Greenlight for 85K

**Month 2 (April):**
- Scale to 85K texts/month
- Target: 180-190 off-markets
- Monitor ratification (should be <30:1)

**Month 3 (May):**
- Scale to 100K texts/month
- Target: 220-240 off-markets ✅
- If sustained: Houston expansion consideration begins

**Critical success factors:**
1. Response rate >1.2% (monitored weekly)
2. Ratification <30:1 (LM trained on selectivity)
3. VA/LM capacity validated at each stage
4. Attribution tracking operational (know what's working)

**If any CSF fails:** Pause, fix, resume. No forced march.

**Confidence level:** MEDIUM-HIGH if staged, LOW if rushed.
