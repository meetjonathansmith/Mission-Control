# DOXA Business Model & Target Ratios
## Documented in November 2025 KPI Sheet

### Target Conversion Ratios (As Documented)

**Text-to-Deal Funnel:**
```
Every 10,000 texts →
  25 leads (400/1 ratio) →
    6 offers (5/1 ratio from offer to contract) →
      1 contract →
        ~1 closing
```

**Key Ratios:**
- **Texts to lead:** 400/1 (0.25% conversion)
- **Texts to deal:** 10,000/1 (0.01% conversion)
- **Offers to contract:** 5/1 (20% conversion)
- **Offers to deal:** 6/1 (16.7% conversion)

### 10 Deal/Month Target Model

**Volume required:**
- **125,000 - 135,000 texts/month**
- **4,800 - 5,200 texts/day**
- **1.25M - 1.35M texts/year**

**Expected output at target:**
- 312-338 leads/month (at 400/1)
- 125-135 offers/month
- 21-23 contracts/month (at 5/1)
- **10 closed deals/month**

**Implied close rate:**
- Contracts → Closed: ~43% (10 closed from 23 contracts)

## November 2025 Actual Performance

**Volume:**
- Total texts: 95,537
- Daily average: ~4,350 texts/day (close to target)

**Funnel:**
- Conversations: 732 (0.77% response rate)
- Off-Market Properties: 124 (17% of conversations)
- Offers Sent: 105
- Ratified/Signed: 5 (noted as "5 signed deals")
- Closed: 0

**Actual ratios vs target:**
- Texts to lead: 131/1 (vs 400/1 target) — BETTER
- Conversations to off-market: 17% 
- Off-market to offers: 85% (???) — This seems wrong, or "off-market" means something different
- Offers to contract: 4.8% (5/105) (vs 20% target) — WORSE

**Analysis:**
If 5 contracts from 105 offers = 4.8% conversion, but target is 20% (5/1 ratio), there's a major gap in offer quality or contract process.

## Critical Insights

### 1. Volume Is Below Target (But Not The Problem)

You're running 80-110k texts/month vs 125-135k target.

**But:** Even at 108k (Dec), you only got 6 contracts. Target says 108k should yield ~11 contracts.

**The issue isn't volume. It's conversion rates.**

### 2. You're 2x Off on Texts-per-Contract

**Target:** 10,000 texts = 1 contract  
**Actual (4-month avg):** ~18,000 texts = 1 contract

**You're paying 2x what the model expects per contract.**

**Why?**
- Lower offer-to-contract conversion (5% actual vs 20% target)
- OR: The 400/1 "texts to lead" ratio in the target model is wrong (you're getting way more conversations than that predicts)

### 3. Response Rate Way Higher Than Model Predicts

**Target model:** 400/1 texts-to-lead = 0.25% response  
**Actual:** 0.77% - 1.52% response (3-6x better than target)

**This is good news!** You're getting 3-6x more conversations than the target model predicts.

**But:** You're not converting those conversations into contracts at the expected rate.

### 4. Offer-to-Contract Is The Constraint

**Target:** 5 offers = 1 contract (20% conversion)  
**Actual:** 
- Nov: 105 offers → 5 contracts (4.8%)
- Dec: 43 offers → 6 contracts (14%)
- Jan: 30 offers → 4 contracts (13%)
- Feb: 33 offers → 2 contracts (6%)

**Average: ~10% offer-to-contract vs 20% target**

**This is your bottleneck.** You're getting conversations and sending offers, but contracts aren't landing at the expected rate.

### 5. The 10-Deal/Month Model Is Achievable (With Fixes)

**Current pace (Feb projection):**
- 110k texts → 2-3 contracts/month → 1-2 closed deals/month

**If you hit target conversion (20% offer-to-contract):**
- 110k texts → ~77 offers → 15 contracts → ~7 closed deals/month

**If you scale to target volume (130k texts) AND hit target conversion:**
- 130k texts → ~91 offers → 18 contracts → **~10 closed deals/month** ✅

**The path:**
1. Fix offer-to-contract (10% → 20%)
2. Scale volume back to 125-135k texts/month
3. Maintain or improve response rate (1%+)

## Where The Model Breaks Down

### Discrepancy 1: "Leads" vs "Conversations"

**Target model:** 10,000 texts → 25 leads (400/1)  
**Your data:** 10,000 texts → 77-152 conversations

**Are "leads" and "conversations" the same?**
- If yes: You're crushing the target by 3-6x
- If no: What's a "lead"? (Agent into world? Off-market property?)

**Best guess:** "Leads" = agents who send off-market properties, not just any response.

**Recalculation if "leads" = off-market properties:**
- Nov: 95k texts → 124 off-market = 767/1 ratio (vs 400/1 target) — Still better
- Dec: 108k texts → 141 off-market = 767/1 ratio — Still better
- Jan: 53k texts → 137 off-market = 390/1 ratio — ON TARGET
- Feb: 48k texts → 107 off-market = 448/1 ratio — Close to target

**This makes more sense.** You're at or near target for getting off-market properties per text.

### Discrepancy 2: "Offers" to "Contracts"

**Target:** 6 offers → 1 deal (16.7%)  
**Also says:** 5 offers → 1 contract (20%)

**Are "contract" and "deal" the same?**
- Contract = ratified offer?
- Deal = closed sale?

**Your tracking:** Offers Sent → Offers Ratified → Deals Closed

**Mapping:**
- Target "contract" = Your "ratified"
- Target "deal" = Your "closed"

**So the funnel should be:**
- 10,000 texts → 25 off-market → 6 offers → 1 ratified → ~1 closed

**But your actual:**
- 10,000 texts → 13 off-market → 4 offers → 0.5 ratified → 0.05 closed (so far)

**Wait, let me recalculate with actual 4-month data...**

## Corrected Funnel Analysis (4-Month Average)

**Volume:** 305,395 texts total (Nov-Feb partial)  
**Outcomes:**
- Conversations: 3,131 (1.03% avg)
- Off-market: 509
- Offers: 211
- Ratified: 17
- Closed: 1

**Actual ratios:**
- Texts → Off-market: 600/1 (vs 400/1 target, 50% worse)
- Off-market → Offers: 2.4/1 (41% conversion)
- Offers → Ratified: 12.4/1 (8% conversion vs 20% target, 60% worse)
- Ratified → Closed: Unknown (only 1 closed so far, timing lag?)

**Key findings:**
1. **Off-market generation is slightly below target** (600/1 vs 400/1)
2. **Offer-to-ratified is WAY below target** (8% vs 20%, your biggest gap)
3. **Ratified-to-closed timing unclear** (need more closed deals to measure)

## Strategic Priorities Based on Target Model

### Priority 1: Fix Offer-to-Ratified Conversion (8% → 20%)

**Current:** 12.4 offers to get 1 ratified (8%)  
**Target:** 5 offers to get 1 ratified (20%)  
**Gap:** You need to 2.5x this conversion rate

**Why are 92% of your offers not getting ratified?**

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Offer quality:** Lowball offers, bad terms?
2. **Agent relationship:** Not enough rapport before offering?
3. **Property quality:** Offers on wrong properties?
4. **Speed:** Too slow to respond, agent goes elsewhere?
5. **Buyer capacity:** Not enough buyers to match properties?

**Action items:**
- Pull last 50 offers that didn't ratify
- Categorize: Why did each fail?
- Identify top 3 failure modes
- Fix systematically

**If you fix this to target (20%), you'd have:**
- 211 offers (4-month) → 42 ratified (vs 17 actual)
- **2.5x more deals in pipeline**

### Priority 2: Improve Off-Market Generation (600/1 → 400/1)

**Current:** 600 texts per off-market property  
**Target:** 400 texts per off-market property  
**Gap:** Need 50% more off-market properties per text

**This ties back to response rate optimization:**
- If response rate improves from 1% to 1.5%, and you maintain 24% conversation-to-off-market...
- 10,000 texts × 1.5% = 150 conversations × 24% = 36 off-market (278/1 ratio!) ⭐

**So:** Fixing response rate also fixes off-market generation.

### Priority 3: Scale Volume to Target (110k → 130k)

**Current:** ~110k texts/month  
**Target:** 125-135k texts/month  
**Gap:** Need 20-25k more texts/month

**But:** Don't scale volume until you fix conversions.

**Why?**
- At current 8% offer-to-ratified, 130k texts = ~3 ratified/month
- At target 20% offer-to-ratified, 130k texts = ~8 ratified/month

**Fix conversions first, then scale.**

## 90-Day Roadmap to 10 Deals/Month

### Month 1 (March 2026): Fix Offer-to-Ratified

**Goal:** 8% → 15% offer-to-ratified conversion

**Actions:**
- Analyze last 100 non-ratified offers (failure mode analysis)
- Tighten offer criteria (only on properties that fit buyer profile)
- Speed up response time (offer within 4 hours of property submission)
- Build buyer bench (need more buyers to increase ratification odds)
- Train LM on offer negotiation tactics

**Target output:** 4-5 ratified deals (vs 2-3 current)

### Month 2 (April 2026): Fix Response Rate

**Goal:** 0.93% → 1.5% response rate

**Actions:**
- Message refresh (3-5 new variations, A/B test)
- List quality audit (pause repeat contacts over 3x)
- VA Beach model replication (test in 3 new markets)
- Campaign segmentation (pause bottom 25% by response rate)

**Target output:** 6-7 ratified deals

### Month 3 (May 2026): Scale Volume

**Goal:** 110k → 130k texts/month

**Actions:**
- Scale high-performing campaigns
- Add new markets with VA Beach model
- Maintain 1.5%+ response rate and 15%+ offer-to-ratified

**Target output:** 8-10 ratified deals → 4-5 closed deals (assuming 50% close rate)

### Month 4+ (June 2026 onwards): Optimize Close Rate

**Goal:** 50% ratified-to-closed rate sustained

**Actions:**
- Track ratified-to-closed timeline (establish baseline)
- Identify and fix drop-off points (financing, inspection, etc)
- Build systems to support higher deal volume

**Target output:** 10 closed deals/month sustained ✅

## Summary: The Gap Between Target and Actual

| Metric | Target | Actual (4-mo avg) | Gap |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----|
| Texts/month | 130,000 | 76,349 | -41% |
| Response rate | 0.25% (implied) | 1.03% | +312% ✅ |
| Texts per off-market | 400/1 | 600/1 | -50% |
| Off-market per offer | 4.2/1 (implied) | 2.4/1 | +75% ✅ |
| Offer to ratified | 20% | 8% | -60% ⚠️ |
| Texts per ratified | 10,000/1 | 18,000/1 | -80% |
| Ratified to closed | ~43% | ~6% (early data) | -86% ⚠️ |
| Closed deals/month | 10 | 0.25 (1 in 4 months) | -97.5% |

**What's working:**
✅ Response rate (3x better than model)  
✅ Off-market to offers (1.75x better than model)

**What's broken:**
⚠️ Offer to ratified (2.5x worse than model) — CRITICAL  
⚠️ Ratified to closed (data incomplete, but looks very low) — CRITICAL  
⚠️ Overall volume (41% below target) — SECONDARY

**The fix:**
1. Offer-to-ratified: 8% → 20% (primary constraint)
2. Ratified-to-closed: Track and optimize (secondary constraint)
3. Volume: 76k → 130k/month (only after fixing conversions)

**Timeline to 10 deals/month:** 3-4 months if you execute on conversion fixes.
