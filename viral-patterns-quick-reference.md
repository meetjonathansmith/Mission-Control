## 📊 POST-PERFORMANCE DECODER

**If a post gets:**

**High Views, Low Engagement:**
- Hook worked, content didn't deliver
- **Fix:** Make body as valuable as hook promises

**Low Views, High Engagement:**
- Great content, weak hook
- **Fix:** Make hook bolder, more curiosity-inducing

**High Saves, Low Shares:**
- Valuable but not conversation-worthy
- **Fix:** Add controversial or relatable element

**High Comments, Low Saves:**
- Engaging but not tactical enough
- **Fix:** Add framework or actionable takeaway

**High Shares, Everything Else Low:**
- Relatable/funny but not building authority
- **Fix:** Balance entertainment with education

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RATIO

**Aim for this balance over a week:**

- **40% Authority** (Sam style: big numbers, frameworks, results)

- **20% Relatability** (Briar style: lifestyle, authenticity, real moments)
- **10% Engagement** (Briar style: questions, contrarian takes, discussions)

**This balance = Credibility + Connection + Community**
