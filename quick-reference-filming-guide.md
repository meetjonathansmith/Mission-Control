## 💬 HIGH-ENGAGEMENT CTA FORMULAS

### **Use These (They Work):**
1. **Public Commitment:** "Comment 'DAY 1' if you're starting the challenge"
2. **Numbered Choice:** "Which point hit hardest? 1, 2, or 3?"
3. **Personal Share:** "What cycle are you breaking? Tell me below."
4. **Identity Declaration:** "Comment 'I am free' to claim it"
5. **Progress Tracking:** "Drop your day number in the comments"
6. **Resource Request:** "DM me 'TEMPLATE' for the download"
7. **Tag:** "Tag someone who needs to hear this"
8. **Question:** "What's your biggest struggle with this?"

### **Avoid These (They Don't):**
- ❌ "Let me know what you think"
- ❌ "Drop a comment below"
- ❌ "Don't forget to like and subscribe"
- ❌ Generic, non-specific asks

## ⏱️ IDEAL VIDEO LENGTH

| Deal Breakdown | 10-12 minutes |
| Rant/Manifesto | 8-12 minutes |
| Challenge Format | 10-14 minutes |

- Be yourself (your weird is your differentiator)

### **Clarity:**
