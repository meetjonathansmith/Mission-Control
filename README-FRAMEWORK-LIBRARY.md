## ❓ FAQ

### **"Which framework should I start with?"**
Framework #7 (Challenge Framework) - It's versatile, high-engagement, and works across all pillars. Plus, public commitment comments boost the algorithm.

### **"Do I need to follow these exactly?"**
No. These are patterns, not scripts. Use them as training wheels. Once you understand why they work, customize and blend them.

### **"What if I don't have proof/screenshots yet?"**
Start with teaching content (Frameworks #2, #10, #14, #16) or personal story (Frameworks #4, #11). Build credibility first, then add deal breakdowns.

### **"How long before I see results?"**
First viral video could happen anytime. But expect 3-6 months of consistent posting (2-3x/week) before the algorithm favors you. This is a marathon.

### **"Can I blend frameworks?"**
Absolutely. The best content often combines 2-3 frameworks. Example: Framework #5 (Faith + Wealth) + Framework #19 (Real Estate Case Study) = "Biblical Stewardship Through Real Estate Deal Breakdown"

### **"What if my audience is different than the research?"**
Use this as your starting point. After 10-20 videos, YOUR data becomes more important than general patterns. Adapt based on what YOUR audience responds to.
