### MONDAY, FEBRUARY 16

**Day:** Monday  
**Pillar:** Life In Christ  
**Series:** None  
**Format:** Reel  
**Title:** The Unsexy Work That Compounds

**Hook option 1:** Proverbs 21:5 says the plans of the diligent lead to profit, and today I am doing the unsexy work.

**Hook option 2:** You know what is not exciting? Auditing spam filters and cleaning contact lists. But that is how you build something real.

**Talking points:**
- Today I am auditing message templates and cleaning dormant contacts from my system
- This is not sexy content, but it is the foundation that lets me scale without collapsing
- God honors diligence, not haste. Kingdom business is built on discipline, not intensity.
- Most people chase breakthroughs. I am building systems that produce consistent results.

**CTA:** If you are building something real and need the reminder that unsexy work matters, save this.

### TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 17

**Day:** Tuesday  
**Pillar:** Documenting The Climb  
**Series:** None  
**Format:** Reel  
**Title:** Training My Team to Handle Volume

**Hook option 1:** Today I am training my lead manager to review properties in 20 minutes without losing quality.

**Hook option 2:** We are scaling from 67 to 200 off market leads per month, so my team needs to get faster without cutting corners.

**Talking points:**
- Volume is coming, so I am preparing my team now
- This is not about working harder, it is about working smarter with better systems
- I filmed part of the training session today, here is what we covered
- Systems beat intensity every time

**CTA:** Comment SYSTEMS if you are building something that needs to scale without you burning out.

### WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 18

**Day:** Wednesday  
**Pillar:** Agent Freedom  
**Series:** Agent Freedom File #1  
**Format:** Reel (60-90 sec)  
**Title:** I Sold 80M and Owned Nothing

**Hook option 1:** I sold over 80 million dollars in real estate as a listing agent and owned nothing.

**Hook option 2:** I was a high volume listing agent for years, grinding 70 hour weeks, and I owned zero rental properties.

**Talking points:**
- I sold everything to other people and kept nothing for myself
- I was exhausted, burned out, and financially dependent on the next deal
- Then I made a shift: I started keeping the best deals and building rental income
- Now I own 17 rental units and have passive income from revenue share at eXp
- This is for agents who are tired of trading time for money and want ownership instead

**CTA:** If you are an agent who resonates with this, DM me the word EQUITY and I will send you a simple starter blueprint.

### THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 19

**Day:** Thursday  
**Pillar:** Tactical Game Plan  
**Series:** None  
**Format:** Carousel  
**Title:** The One Thing I Would Do Differently as an Agent

**Hook option 1:** If I were starting as a real estate agent today, this is the one thing I would do differently.

**Hook option 2:** After selling 80M in real estate, here is what I wish I had done from day one.

**Talking points:**
- Stop selling every listing to investors and keep the best ones for yourself
- Look for properties that need light work, buy them, rent them out, build equity
- You have more access to deals than any investor, use it
- Start with one property, then build from there
- Your future self will thank you for the passive income

**CTA:** Save this if you are an agent who wants to start building ownership this year.

### FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 20

**Day:** Friday  
**Pillar:** Leadership & Life  
**Series:** None  
**Format:** Reel  
**Title:** What I Learned This Week

**Hook option 1:** I spent this week doing foundation work, and God reminded me that diligence beats haste every time.

**Hook option 2:** This week I audited systems, trained my team, and did the work nobody sees. Here is what I learned.

**Talking points:**
- Monday I audited message templates, Tuesday I trained my lead manager, Wednesday I shared my story
- None of it felt like progress in the moment, but all of it is building something sustainable
- Exodus 23:30 says God will drive them out little by little, and that is how I am building this business
- Grateful for what is working: 4 deals in the pipeline, 13 to 1 conversion rate, a team that is ready to scale

**CTA:** If you needed the reminder that slow and steady wins, share this with someone who is building something real.

### SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 21

**Day:** Saturday  
**Pillar:** Agent Freedom  
**Series:** None  
**Format:** Reel  
**Title:** The Lie Brokerages Tell New Agents

**Hook option 1:** The lie every brokerage tells new agents: you need to grind for 10 years before you can invest.

**Hook option 2:** Brokerages will tell you to sell everything and keep nothing, and that is how agents stay broke.

**Talking points:**
- You do not need to wait 10 years to start building ownership
- You have access to off market deals that most investors will never see
- Start small: keep one deal, rent it out, build equity
- The commission model keeps you dependent on the next deal, ownership sets you free
- I wish someone had told me this when I started

**CTA:** If you are an agent and this hit you, comment FREEDOM and I will reach out.

## 🔭 SCOUT — Growth Advisory

Scout is mostly silent this week. Execution > expansion.

**One note:**

Houston keeps coming up in conversations. Not yet.

Prove DMV at 10 deals/month for 2+ consecutive months first. Target: June 2026.

Week 1 is about fixing the constraint (67 → 200 off-markets). Stay focused.

Discipline now = leverage later.
