# The Smith Letter — Draft for Week of February 17, 2026

---

Happy Thursday!

The market is moving faster than most operators realize.

Here's what I mean...

Last week I ran five offers. Three years ago, five offers in a week would've meant scrambling for capital, losing sleep over comps, and praying I didn't overpay.

Today? I underwrote all five in under two hours. Not because the deals got simpler—they didn't. Because my internal model got sharper.

Every deal you run trains your brain. Every acceptance and rejection calibrates your instincts. Over time, what used to feel risky starts to feel normal.

The operators winning right now aren't waiting for certainty. They're moving on conviction built from reps.

That's what this letter is for—helping you see the signals others miss and move decisively when the moment's right.

Let's look at what moved last week.

## What's Moving the Market

### Trump Executive Order Targets Institutional Buyers in Housing Market

President Trump signed an executive order on January 20 titled "Stopping Wall Street from Competing with Main Street Homebuyers," directing federal agencies to restrict support for large institutional investor purchases of single-family homes. The order mandates that the Treasury Secretary define "large institutional investor" and "single-family home" by February 19—this week. The policy blocks federal programs from facilitating sales to institutional buyers but includes a carve-out for build-to-rent developments. Reuters reports the order directs the administration to "review acquisitions by large investors" and "promote home sales to individual buyers."

Why it matters:

This doesn't ban private transactions, but it cuts off federal funding pipelines. Institutional buyers will still compete where they self-finance, but government-backed deals shift to retail buyers. Watch the Treasury definitions—if "large" means 100+ properties, small syndicates stay in the game. If it's 10+ properties, the field narrows fast. For operators: this is a positioning moment, not a panic moment.

### Mortgage Affordability Hits Four-Year High as Rates Drop Below 6.1%

Mortgage rate declines in early January pushed housing affordability to a four-year high, according to ICE Mortgage Technology's February 2026 Mortgage Monitor Report. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.09% as of February 12, down from 6.8% in early 2024. The report shows nearly 5 million borrowers now have refinance opportunities, and the lock-in effect is fading as more homeowners hold mortgages above 6%. NAR economists project affordability will continue improving in 2026 as home prices remain flat (forecast: 2% growth) and household incomes rise faster than monthly payments. Windermere reports housing inventory is now only 9% below February 2020 levels.

Why it matters:

The 2021-2023 lock-in effect is breaking. Inventory is coming back. Motivated sellers who sat out 2023-2024 at 3% rates are now willing to move. Pipeline is filling. Watch for acceleration in Q2-Q3 as buyers realize rates won't drop to 4%. For operators: this is your window. The sellers moving now are the ones who need to, not the ones who want to.

### Housing Reform Bill Passes House 390-9, Legalizes ADUs and Duplexes Nationwide

The U.S. House passed sweeping housing reform legislation on Monday, voting 390-9 to advance the Housing for the 21st Century Act. The bill legalizes duplexes, triplexes, and accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in single-family zones, eliminates parking minimums, streamlines environmental reviews for projects under 15 units, and raises FHA multifamily loan limits by 300-400%. Manufactured housing rules are rewritten to eliminate the permanent chassis requirement, treating factory-built homes on permanent foundations like site-built homes for financing and taxation. HousingWire reports the bill creates pilot grants for cities to develop pre-approved "pattern books"—standardized designs that bypass case-by-case reviews.

Why it matters:

This is the most aggressive federal zoning reform in 50 years. Duplex, triplex, and ADU legalization opens conversion plays in restrictive suburban markets. Environmental review exemptions cut 6-12 months off project timelines. Higher FHA limits unlock small multifamily deals that were previously unfeasible. Senate passage expected in Q2—start identifying conversion targets now. The market that opens six months from now is being shaped today.

## What's Worth Watching

### Foreclosure Activity Rises for 11th Straight Month—But Inventory Isn't Flooding Yet

ATTOM Data's January 2026 Foreclosure Market Report shows foreclosure starts rose 26% year-over-year, while completed foreclosures increased 59% from a year ago. The report marks the 11th consecutive month of annual increases, with 367,460 properties receiving foreclosure filings in 2025 (up 14% from 2024). Foreclosure activity remains below pre-pandemic levels and dramatically lower than 2008-2010 peaks, but the trend is accelerating. ATTOM reports foreclosure starts in January climbed 20% from November 2025, and completed foreclosures increased 32% year-over-year.

Why it matters:

Foreclosure pipelines are filling, but inventory isn't flooding the market yet. That lag creates opportunity for operators who can move fast on pre-foreclosure deals before institutional buyers scale up. Watch for acceleration in Q3-Q4 2026 as 2023-2024 forbearance expirations work through the system. This is a volume play—not a 2008-style crash. Position for flow, not collapse.

### Insurance Costs Reshape Homebuyer Decisions as Premiums Rise 24% Since 2021

Home insurance premiums have risen 24% since 2021, and most homeowners expect further increases in 2026, according to a HousingWire report. Nearly half of buyers say insurance costs heavily influence purchasing decisions, with climate risk driving pricing across wildfire, flood, and storm-prone regions. Florida premiums increased an average of $1,450 between 2020-2023, while replacement costs surged 55% between 2020-2022 (Insurance Information Institute data). Severe convective storms, wildfires, and flooding remain primary drivers of underwriting in 2026, with insurers pricing in long-term climate exposure.

Why it matters:

This is a hidden affordability killer. Monthly PITI calculations are breaking in high-risk markets where insurance adds $200-400/month. For operators: underwrite insurance as aggressively as you underwrite property taxes. Coastal and wildfire-adjacent deals that pencil at 6% rates don't pencil at 6% + $350/month insurance. Distressed inventory will build in uninsurable markets—opportunity for cash buyers who self-insure or know how to structure around it.

### Regional Housing Starts Diverge Sharply as West Contracts, South Expands

U.S. housing starts data shows sharp regional divergence in Q4 2025, with the West down 21.9% to 243,000 units, while the South rose 1.2% to 650,000 units and the Midwest increased 0.5% to 199,000 units, according to Census Bureau data reported by Trading Economics. The Northeast saw a slight decline of 0.6% to 154,000 units. Overall housing starts averaged 118,792 new units per month in 2023 (seasonally adjusted), down 8.11% from 2022. The next housing starts report is scheduled for release February 25.

Why it matters:

National headlines don't tell the whole story. Local fundamentals matter more than macro narratives. The West is contracting (regulation, insurance, costs) while the South absorbs migration and job growth. For operators: watch for supply/demand imbalances in secondary metros. Nashville, Charlotte, Raleigh are building fast—cap rate compression ahead. Boise, Phoenix, Vegas are slowing—distress inventory building. Don't bet on "the housing market." Bet on the right markets.

## Jon's Take

This doesn't feel like 2008. And it doesn't feel like 2021 either.

It feels like a sorting year.

Affordability is improving, but insurance is destroying it in half the country. Foreclosures are rising, but inventory isn't flooding. Washington wants to help first-time buyers, but also doesn't want homeowners' equity to drop. Zoning reform passed the House 390-9, but local implementation will take years.

Here's what I see:

The operators who win in 2026 aren't the ones with perfect information. Everyone has access to the same data. The edge is disciplined execution and accurate prediction.

Foreclosure pipelines are filling slowly—that lag creates pre-foreclosure opportunity before institutional buyers scale up. Affordability is at a four-year high, but it won't last—this is the window. ADU and duplex legalization opens conversion plays, but only for operators who move before everyone else figures it out. Insurance is repricing risk in real time—underwrite it now or eat it later.

If there's a theme for 2026, it's this: local fundamentals beat national narratives. Regional divergence is accelerating. Nashville isn't Phoenix. Baltimore isn't Boise.

I'm not waiting for clarity. I'm moving on conviction built from reps.

And if you're sitting on off-market inventory, distressed listings, or sellers who need speed over price? That's exactly the kind of deal flow I'm built for.
