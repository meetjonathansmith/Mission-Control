# SHAME REEL SCRIPT - READY TO FILM

Kingdom + Neuroscience crossover content. 60-75 seconds. Observation question hook (tested and approved by Jonathan).

---

## HOOK (0-3 seconds)
*[On screen, curious/observant tone]*

**"Ever notice how beating yourself up feels... productive?"**

---

## PATTERN INTERRUPT (3-8 seconds)
*[Pause, slight head tilt]*

**"Like somehow making yourself the problem is easier than solving the actual problem?"**

*[Cut to B-roll: person stressed at desk, then back]*

**"Here's what's actually happening."**

---

## THE SETUP (8-15 seconds)
*[Back to camera, walking/moving]*

**"Your brain is wired to reduce uncertainty. Uncertainty feels unsafe. So when something goes wrong, shame creates instant clarity. Fast action. Relief."**

*[Pause]*

**"But here's the trap..."**

---

## THE BREAKDOWN (15-40 seconds)
*[Tight frame, direct to camera]*

**"Your brain has two options:**

**Option 1:** Process complexity. Multiple variables. Context. Timing. Skills.

*[Shakes head]*

**That takes energy.**

**Option 2:** 'I'm the problem.'

*[Snap fingers]*

**Boom. Done. Clean narrative."**

*[Lean in]*

**"Shame collapses uncertainty into certainty. And certainty? Feels like relief."**

---

## THE COST (40-55 seconds)
*[B-roll: burned out person, then back to camera]*

**"But here's what it actually does:**

• Activates your amygdala
• Floods you with cortisol  
• Narrows your focus
• Kills creativity
• Shrinks your identity"**

*[Pause, serious]*

**"You become efficient... but brittle."**

---

## THE REFRAME (55-70 seconds)
*[Shift tone — hopeful but grounded]*

**"So here's the upgrade:**

**Instead of:** 'What's wrong with me?'

**Ask:** 'What is the system interpreting — and is that accurate?'"**

*[Gesture]*

**"That keeps complexity alive. Which keeps GROWTH alive."**

---

## CTA (70-75 seconds)
*[Direct to camera, softer]*

**"Stop trading growth for control.**

**Comment 'DATA' if this landed."**

---

## FORMAT NOTES
- Talking head primary (minimal B-roll)
- Observation question hook = pull energy (tested stronger than claim hook)
- Kingdom + neuroscience = Jonathan's unique positioning
- Built using Dan Martell viral framework (sam.gaudet analysis)

**STATUS:** Ready to film today.
