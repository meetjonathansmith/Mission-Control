- Threaded for comp integration

### 2. Sights
- **Trijicon Suppressor Height Sights**
- Orange front post with OD Green rear
- Required height for co-witnessing with optic
- Backup iron sights through red dot window

### 3. Trigger (Choose One)

**Option A: FACTR Glock Trigger (Upgraded)**
- Premium aftermarket trigger
- Flat face, cleaner break
- More expensive but significant improvement

**Option B: Glock Performance Trigger**
- Factory+ option (lighter pull, keeps Glock internals)
- More conservative, maintains full reliability
- Good for carry/duty use

### 4. Weapon Light
- **Surefire X300T Weapon Light**
- 66,000 candela, tightly-focused beam
- Alternative: X300U-B (same dimensions, older model)
- Standard for duty/tactical use

- Adds 5 rounds to standard Glock 17 mags (17→22 rounds)

- Faster reloads, competition/duty ready
- "Space Age Form & Function"

## Build Notes

1. **Non-MOS Note:** The build page mentions the author prefers non-MOS with slide milling (adapter plates = failure point). Since you already have the optic mounted, you're good.

2. **Comp Consideration:** RAMJET barrel + AFTERBURNER comp changes the recoil impulse significantly. Test with carry ammo before trusting it for EDC.

3. **Trigger Choice:** 
   - **FACTR** = performance/competition focus
   - **Glock Performance** = duty/carry reliability focus
   - Don't mix trigger components between brands

4. **Light Holster Compatibility:** X300T is standard footprint - most quality holster makers support it.

5. **Mag Extensions:** FACTR+5 works on standard G17 mags (22 round capacity). Verify these fit your current holsters/mag pouches.

## Priority Order (if budgeting)

1. **Sights** - Critical for optic co-witness
2. **Trigger** - Biggest feel/performance improvement
3. **Weapon Light** - Essential for home defense/duty
4. **Barrel/Comp** - Nice to have, substantial upgrade
5. **Magwell** - Quality of life improvement
6. **Mag Extensions** - Bonus capacity
