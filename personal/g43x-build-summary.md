## Build Notes

1. **MOS vs. Milled:** You're getting the MOS version, which has a removable plate system. The Holosun EPS should mount directly - verify you don't need additional slide work.

2. **Magazine Compatibility:** Shield Arms S15 mags require their proprietary mag release (usually included in combo kit). Verify this is part of the kit.

3. **Trigger Install:** Factr triggers may require fitting/installation by a gunsmith. Check if you're comfortable with DIY or need professional install.

4. **Holster Selection:** Make sure holster is compatible with:
   - Light (if you add one later)
   - Optic height
   - Shield Arms magazine baseplate
